</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> Lives of Wesley have been already published, besides
sketches almost innumerable. What then justifies the present
writer in publishing another?</p>

<p>Hampson’s, ready for the press when Wesley died, is extremely
meagre, and was the work of an angry writer. Coke
and Moore’s, issued in 1792, was a hasty publication, written
<i>currente calamo</i>, to get possession of the market; and, like
most things done in haste, was exceedingly imperfect.
Whitehead’s, dated 1793-6, was composed in the midst of
disgraceful contentions, and was tinged with party feeling.
Southey’s, printed in 1820, has literary charms; but, unintentionally,
is full of errors, and, for want of dates and chronological
exactitude, is extremely confusing. Moore’s, published
in 1824, is the fullest and most reliable; but, to a great extent,
it is a mere reprint of Whitehead’s, given to the public about
thirty years previously. Watson’s, issued in 1831, was not
intended to supersede larger publications, but was “contracted
within moderate limits, and” avowedly “prepared
with special reference to general readers.”</p>

<p>These are the chief Lives of Wesley. Smaller ones are too
numerous to be mentioned; and, besides that, they are not
<i>lives</i>, but <i>sketches</i>.</p>

<p>The publications of Hampson, of Coke and Moore, of
Whitehead, and of Moore, have long been out of print. Two
Lives are still on sale,—Southey’s and Watson’s; but the
former is defective in details, and is incorrect and misleading;
and the latter, as already stated, was never meant to occupy
the place of a larger work.</p>

<p>It has long been confessed that a Life of Wesley, worthy
of the man, is a desideratum. Hampson, Coke, Moore, and
Whitehead used, with a sparing hand, the materials which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
were already accessible to all, and added a few original
papers, for the preservation of which every one feels grateful.
Southey acknowledges that he “had no private sources of
information”; and, in the list of books from which his
materials were chiefly taken, we find nothing but what is in
the hands of most Methodist students. Watson says, he had
“the advantage of consulting unpublished papers”; but it
is not injustice to Watson, to say that very few of these
“unpublished papers” were embodied in his book.</p>

<p>This is not ill natured depreciation of previous biographers,
all of whom I revere, and wish to honour. But any ordinary
reader, who will take the trouble, may easily perceive, that
the Lives of Wesley that have been published, during the
last seventy-six years, have contained no additional information
worth naming.</p>

<p>In this interval, Wesley has yearly been growing in historic
fame, until he is now, among all parties,—Churchmen,
Methodists and Dissenters, papists, protestants and infidels,
statesmen, philosophers and men of letters,—one of the greatest
and most interesting studies of the age. The world wishes to
know something more respecting the man, who, under God,
was the means of bringing about the greatest reformation of
modern times. Since the publications of Whitehead, Coke
and Moore—his literary executors—innumerable letters and
other manuscripts have come to light; but no subsequent
biographer has used them. Besides, in the magazines, newspapers,
broadsheets, pamphlets, tracts, and songs, published
during Wesley’s lifetime, there is a mine of biographical
material incalculably rich; but, hitherto, no one has taken the
trouble to delve and to explore it.</p>

<p>Ought this apathy and negligence to continue longer? Is
it right to keep the world, the church, and especially the
Methodists, in ignorance of what exists concerning one of the
most remarkable men that ever lived? I think not; and,
hence, as no one else attempted it, I have done my best to
collect these scattered facts, and to give them to the public in
the following volumes.</p>

<p>For seventeen years, materials have been accumulating in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
my hands. My own mass of original manuscripts is large.
Thousands of Methodist letters have been lent to me.
Hundreds, almost thousands, of publications, issued in Wesley’s
lifetime, and bearing on the great Methodist movement, have
been consulted. Many of Wesley’s letters, hitherto published
only in periodicals, or in scarce books, have been used; and
not a few that, up to the present, have never yet appeared
in print. To mention all who have rendered me generous
assistance is almost impossible; but I cannot deny myself
the pleasure of naming the late Rev. Joseph Entwisle, Mr.
Joseph Miller, of Newcastle, Mr. George Stevenson, of
Paternoster Row, and last, but not least, the Rev. Elijah
Hoole, D.D., for the ready access he gave me to the collection
of manuscripts in the Wesleyan Mission House.</p>

<p>My greatest difficulty has been, not the want of materials,
but that of making selections, and of giving in a condensed
form all that I thought important. Nothing, likely to be of
general interest, has been withheld. Nothing, derogatory to
the subject of these memoirs, has been kept back. Whatever
else the work may be, it is <i>honest</i>.</p>

<p>I have tried to make Wesley his own biographer. I have
not attempted what may be called the <i>philosophy</i> of
Wesley’s life. I leave that to others. As a rule, intelligent
readers wish only to be possessed of facts. They can form
their own conclusions; and care but little about the opinions
of those by whom the facts are collected and narrated. The
temptation to moralise has oft been great; but I have
tried to practise self denial. Wesley was not a <i>designing</i> man:
cunning he had none: he was a man of one idea: his
sole aim was to save souls. This was the philosophy of his
life. All his actions had reference to this. He had no preconceived
plans; and, hence, it is needless to speculate about
his motives. The man is best known by what he <i>did</i>; not
by what philosophers may suspect he <i>thought</i>. Holding these
opinions, my one object has been to collect, collate, and
register unvarnished facts; and I hope I have not altogether
failed.</p>

<p>Much that is false, or erroneous, concerning Wesley, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
been published; and it would have been an easy task to have
refuted not a few of the statements which even Methodists as
well as others have been accustomed to receive without gainsaying;
but I had no room for this. Besides, I had no wish
to assume the part of a controversialist. Comparison will
show, that, in several instances, I differ from previous biographers;
but I would rather that the reader should discover
this for himself, than that I should state it. It may savour
of unpardonable temerity to disagree with the distinguished
men who have gone before me; but, if attacked, I am prepared
to defend the ground that I have taken. To avoid
encumbering the margin, I have omitted thousands of
references; but I have them, and can give them, if required.</p>

<p>The work has been arduous; but it has been a work of
love. I have not done what I wished, but what I could. A
more literary and philosophic writer might have been employed;
but no labour has been spared in pursuit of facts,
and there has been no tampering with honour and honesty
in stating them.</p>

<p>The Portrait inserted in Vol. I. is taken from an exceedingly
scarce engraving, published in 1743, and made from a
painting by J. Williams. It is more than probable that this
was the first likeness of Wesley ever taken.</p>

<p>I only add, that I hope the reader will find the general
Index at the end of Vol. III. to be accurate and useful.</p>

<p class="center"><i>METHODISM: ITS GREATNESS.</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap">IS it not a truth that Methodism is the greatest fact in the
history of the church of Christ? Methodism has now
existed one hundred and thirty years. Is there any other
system that has spread itself so widely in an equal period?
We doubt it.</p>

<p>In the first two centuries of the Christian era, during a
great part of which men were blessed with plenary inspiration,
and miracles were wrought, the Christian religion sprung up
in Judæa, Samaria, and Galilee. Churches were raised at
Antioch, in the beautiful isle of Cyprus, in the neighbouring
provinces of Pamphylia, and Pisidia, and Lycaonia, and
Galatia, and Phrygia, and, in fact, throughout Asia Minor
in general. Berea, Philippi, Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth,
and other cities in Greece, were visited with the light of truth.
Christianity then spread through a large portion of other
parts of the Roman empire, and reached as far as even
Lyons in France.</p>

<p>This was marvellous success; but, as it respects geographical
extent, the spread of Methodism is more marvellous.
The Roman empire embraced the whole of the places above
mentioned. It extended three thousand miles in length and
two thousand miles in breadth, and comprised the most fertile
and best cultivated part of the known world. Its limits were
the Atlantic on the west; the Rhine and Danube on the
north; the Euphrates on the east; and the deserts of Arabia
and Africa on the south. This was a vast area; but, compared
with that over which Methodism has spread itself during
the last hundred and thirty years, it is insignificantly small.
If Methodism does not exist in Palestine, Asia Minor, Arabia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
Greece, or Egypt, it exists in Britain, France, Germany,
Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and
Africa: and, passing to other regions which the Romans never
trod, it has long since entered India and Ceylon; it has
already won its triumphs in the flowery land of the Chinese;
it has a vast multitude of adherents in Australia, and the
islands of the Pacific Ocean; in the West Indies its converts
are numbered by tens of thousands; while in America it has
diffused its blessings from the most remote settlements of
Canada in the north to the Gulf of Mexico in the south, and
from Nova Scotia in the east to California in the west.</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">Sets the kingdoms on a blaze.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Take another epoch of the church’s history—the Reformation,
begun by Luther, in the year 1517. This immense
revival of truth and godliness, in the midst of a corrupted
church, established itself in many parts of the German empire,
where it continues to the present day. It was propagated in
Sweden by one of Luther’s disciples, Olaus Petri. In Denmark,
it was spread by Martin Reinard and Carlostadt. In
France, it found a patroness in Margaret, Queen of Navarre.
In Switzerland, John Calvin became famous as one of its great
apostles. It made considerable progress in Spain, Hungary,
Bohemia, and Poland. In the Netherlands, upwards of a
hundred thousand persons were cruelly put to death because
of their embracing it. In all the provinces of Italy, but more
especially in the territories of Venice, Tuscany, and Naples,
great numbers of people, of all ranks, were led by it to express
an aversion to the Papal yoke. In Spain, not a few embraced
it, and even Charles V. himself is presumed to have died a
Protestant. In England, Henry VIII. unintentionally helped
it forward by usurping the chair of church supremacy, hitherto
occupied by his holiness the Pope; while his only son, King
Edward VI., was its brightest ornament, and, in some respects,
its most effectual support. In Ireland, George Brown, Archbishop
of Dublin, pulled down images, destroyed relics, and
purged the churches within his diocese from superstitious rites.
While in Scotland, John Knox, a disciple of Calvin, launched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
his thunders against the Vatican, until he shook it to its base;
and, at last, Queen Elizabeth, by an army, put an end to
Popery in the whole of the Caledonian kingdom.</p>

<p>This was a glorious and wide-spread work, the blessed
results of which will be felt to the latest generations. But
compare it with Methodism, and say which, in the same
number of years, made the greater progress, and established
itself in the widest extent of country. It is no disparagement
to the Protestant Reformation to affirm that, in this respect,
Methodism is immensely its superior.</p>

<p>Look at this religious system as it now exists. The
“Methodist,” or parent “Conference,” employs in Great
Britain and Ireland 1782 regular ministers. Besides these,
there were, in 1864, in England only, 11,804 lay preachers,
preaching 8754 sermons every sabbath-day. In the same
year, the number of preaching places in England only, was
6718, and the number of sermons preached weekly, by
ministers and lay preachers combined, was 13,852.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To these
must be added the lay preachers, preaching places, etc., in
Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Shetland, and the Channel Islands.
The number of church members in Great Britain and Ireland
is 365,285, with 21,223 on trial; and, calculating that the
hearers are three times as numerous as the church members,
there are considerably more than a million persons in the
United Kingdom who are attendants upon the religious services
of the <i>parent</i> Conference of “the people called Methodists.”
Some idea of their chapel and school property may
be formed from the fact that, during the last seven years,
there has been expended, in Great Britain only, in new erections
and in reducing debts on existing buildings, £1,672,541;
and, towards that amount of expenditure, there has been
actually raised and paid (exclusive of all Connexional collections,
loans, and grants) the sum of £1,284,498. During
the ten years, from 1859 to 1868 inclusive, there was raised
for the support of the foreign missions of the Connexion
£1,408,235; and, if to this there be added the amount of the
Jubilee Fund, we find more than a million and a half sterling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
contributed during the decade for the sustenance and extension
of the Methodist work in foreign lands. The missions
now referred to are carried on in Ireland, France, Switzerland,
Germany, Italy, Gibraltar, India, Ceylon, China, South
and West Africa, the West Indies, Canada, Eastern British
America, Australia, and Polynesia. In these distant places,
the committee having the management of the missions employ
3798 paid agents, including 994 who are regularly ordained,
and are wholly engaged in the work of the Christian ministry.
Besides these, there are about 20,000 agents of the Society
(as lay preachers, etc.), who are rendering important service
gratuitously; while the number of church members is 154,187,
and the number of attendants upon the religious services
more than half a million. Space prevents a reference to the
other institutions and funds of British Methodism, except
to add that, besides 174,721 children in the mission schools,
the parent Connexion has in Great Britain 698 day-schools,
efficiently conducted by 1532 certificated, assistant, and pupil
teachers, and containing 119,070 scholars; also 5328 Sunday-schools,
containing 601,801 scholars, taught by 103,441 persons
who render their services gratuitously; and that the
total number of publications printed and issued by the English
Book Committee only, during the year ending June 1866,
was four millions one hundred and twenty-two thousand eight
hundred, of which nearly two millions were periodicals, and
more than a quarter of a million were hymn-books.</p>

<p>These statistics are significant of great facts. At a moderate
computation, there are at least two millions of persons
regularly worshipping in the chapels, schools, etc., of the original
body of “the people called Methodists.”</p>

<p>Leaving what is sometimes called the “Old Connexion,” we
proceed to glance at the <i>branches</i> of the Methodist family.</p>

<p><i>The Welsh Calvinistic Methodists.</i>—The societies of this
section of Methodists were founded by Howel Harris, an early
friend and companion of Wesley and Whitefield, and principally
exist in Wales. At the census of 1851, they had 828
chapels, capable of accommodating about 212,000 persons,
and which had cost nearly a million sterling. In 1853 they
had 207 ministers, 234 lay preachers, and 58,577 church
members.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p><i>The Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion.</i>—In 1748 Whitefield
became the chaplain of the Countess of Huntingdon,
who, by his advice, assumed a kind of leadership over his
followers, erected chapels, engaged ministers or laymen to
officiate in them, and afterwards founded a college at Trevecca,
in Wales, for the education of Calvinistic preachers. At her
death, the college was transferred to Cheshunt, and there it
still exists. Although the name “Connexion” continues to
be used, the Congregational polity is practically adopted; and,
of late years, several of the congregations have become, in
name as well as virtually, Congregational churches. The
number of chapels, mentioned in the census of 1851, as
belonging to this Connexion, was 109, containing accommodation
for 38,727 persons, and the attendance on the census
Sunday was 19,159.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><i>The Methodist New Connexion</i> was formed in the year 1797;
the principal, if not only difference, between it and the parent
body, being the different degrees of power allowed in each
communion to the laity. At the Conference of 1869, the
New Connexion had, at home and abroad, 260 ministers, and
35,706 church members.</p>

<p><i>The Band Room Methodists</i> had their origin in Manchester,
in 1806. Their chief leaders were John and E. Broadhurst,
Holland Hoole, Nathaniel Williamson, and Thomas Painter.
Of the earnestness of these godly men there can be no
question; but, as in the case of many who have been called
revivalists, their zeal was often boisterous and irregular, and
sometimes obstinate. Their meetings were chiefly held in what
was known as the Band Room, in North Street. Their chief
faults were admitting persons to band meetings without
showing their society tickets; having penitent benches and
noisy prayer-meetings; holding cottage services; and, lastly
and especially, acting independently of leaders’ meetings.
The Band Room Methodists still exist; but are now called,
“The United Free Gospel Churches.” They hold annual
conferences; have fifty-nine churches, chiefly in Lancashire
and Yorkshire; and differ from the parent Connexion, not in
doctrines, but in having no paid ministers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p><i>The Primitive Methodists</i> sprang up in Staffordshire in
1810. The doctrines they teach are precisely similar to those
of the original Connexion. At the conference of 1868 they
had, at home and abroad, 943 ministers, about 14,000 lay
preachers, nearly 10,000 classleaders, 3360 connexional
chapels, 2963 rented chapels and rooms for religious worship,
3282 Sunday-schools, above 40,000 Sunday-school teachers,
258,857 Sunday-school scholars, and 161,229 church members.</p>

<p><i>The Bible Christians</i>, sometimes called “Bryanites,” were
founded by William O’Bryan, a Wesleyan local preacher, in
Cornwall, in 1815. They principally exist in Cornwall and
the West of England, but also have mission stations in the
Channel Islands, the United States, Canada, Prince Edward’s
Island, and Australia. Like the parent Connexion they have
class-meetings, circuits, district-meetings, and a Conference.
Their statistics, for 1869, are about 700 chapels and 300 other
preaching places, 254 ministers, 1759 lay preachers, 44,221
Sunday-school scholars, 8913 Sunday-school teachers, and
26,241 full and accredited church members.</p>

<p><i>The Primitive Methodists in Ireland</i> seceded from the
parent body in 1817. At that time the Irish Conference, at
the urgent request of many of the Irish societies, agreed that
the ministers in full connection should administer the sacraments
of baptism and the Lord’s supper, in circuits making
proper application to that effect. This occasioned great commotion.
A number of leaders and local preachers assembled
at Clones, in the beginning of 1817, and formed themselves
into a separate Connexion, the only difference between them
and their quondam friends being, that their ministers should
not administer baptism and the Lord’s supper, but should
leave their societies at perfect liberty to partake of those
sacraments in the churches to which they respectively belonged.
In 1816 there were in Ireland 28,542 members of
society; but in two years, and in consequence of this senseless
schism, that number was reduced to 19,052. The new body
took the name of Primitive Methodists, and still continue a
separated people on the one principle already mentioned. In
1861, they had in Ireland, 61 circuits, 85 ministers, and 14,247
members of society.</p>

<p><i>The United Methodist Free Churches</i> are an amalgamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
of three different secessions from the original Connexion,
1. The Protestant Methodists, who were formed into a distinct
body in 1828, when upwards of 1000 members separated from
the Leeds societies, because of the proceedings of the special
district-meeting convened to settle the disputes arising out of
the introduction of an organ into Brunswick Chapel. 2. The
Wesleyan Methodist Association, which sprung out of the
controversy in 1834, concerning the then proposed Theological
Institution. 3. The Reformers, who were expelled, or who
seceded, during the terrible agitation which occurred in
1849. These amalgamated bodies have, in 1869, ministers,
312; lay preachers, 3445; chapels, 1228; Sunday-scholars,
152,315; church members, 68,062.</p>

<p><i>The Wesleyan Reform Union</i> consists of those Reformers of
1849 who refused to amalgamate with the United Methodist
Free Churches. In 1868, the Union had 20 ministers, 608
lay preachers, 276 chapels and preaching places, 580 classleaders,
18,475 Sunday-scholars, and 9393 church members.</p>

<p>The above comprise all the Methodist bodies now existing
in the United Kingdom. Some others have occasionally
sprung up, such as the <i>Tent Methodists</i>, the <i>Independent
Methodists</i>, etc.; but they are now either extinct or incorporated
with other churches. Not reckoning the Band Room Methodists,
nor the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion, and making
a moderate <i>estimate</i> of the Sunday-school scholars belonging
to the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists and to the Primitive
Methodists in Ireland, we arrive at the following results.</p>

<p>Marvellous, however, as the success of Methodism has been
in the United Kingdom, it has been far more marvellous in
the United States. There it holds and preaches precisely the
same doctrines as are held and preached in England. There,
as here, it is intensely loyal; and, during the late terrific war,
sent a hundred thousand white, and seventy-five thousand,
black troops into the field of battle under the loyal flag. It
is dotting the whole of the vast American continent with its
church edifices, and has perhaps the most powerful religious
press of which the world can boast. Let the reader ponder
the significance of the following statistics for the year 1869,

<p>In connection with its schools, there are libraries containing
more than two millions and a half of books. Its Book Concern
has about thirty cylinder power-presses in constant operation;
and about 2000 different books on its catalogue, besides
tracts, etc., and 14 periodicals, with an aggregate circulation
of more than twelve millions every year. It also has a great
Missionary Society, with prosperous missions in China, India,
Africa, Bulgaria, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, and other places.</p>

<p>The returns for <i>the Methodist Episcopal Church South</i>, in
1869, are 2581 ministers, 3951 lay preachers, and 535,040
church members.</p>

<p><i>The Methodist Episcopal Church</i> in Canada has 216 ministers,
224 lay preachers, and 20,000 members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Besides the above, there are other Transatlantic Methodists,
as:—1. The African Methodist Episcopal Church, which, in
1867, had 14 annual Conferences, 673 chapels, 509 travelling
preachers, 727 local preachers, 130,950 members, 33,134
Sunday-school scholars, and 40,716 volumes in Sunday-school
libraries. 2. The Methodist Protestant Church, with about
90,000 members. 3. The American Wesleyan Methodists,
with above 20,000 members. 4. The German Methodists,
with 46,000 members. 5. Three or four smaller sects, which
need no further notice. The aggregate membership of these
several Methodistic bodies may be fairly estimated at about
300,000, and their ministers and preachers at 5000.</p>

<p>We thus make a total of more than twelve millions of persons
receiving Methodist instruction, and, from week to week,
meeting together in Methodist buildings for the purpose of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
worshipping Almighty God. The statement is startling, but
the statistics given entitle it to the fullest consideration.</p>

<p>But rightly to estimate the results of Methodism during
the last hundred and thirty years, there are other facts to be
remembered.</p>

<p>Who will deny, for instance, that Methodism has exercised
a potent and beneficial influence upon other churches:
Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independent, and Baptist churches
have all been largely indebted to Methodism, either directly
or indirectly, for many of the best ministers and agents they
have ever had. It is a remarkable fact that, during Wesley’s
lifetime, of the 690 men who acted under him as itinerant
preachers, 249 relinquished the itinerant ministry. These
249 <i>retirers</i> included not a few of the most intelligent,
energetic, pious, and useful preachers that Wesley had. Some
left him on the ground of health; others began business, because
as itinerant preachers they were unable to support their
wives and families; but a large proportion became ordained
ministers in other churches. In some instances, the labours
of these men, and their brother Methodists, led to marvellous
results. To give but one example,—David Taylor, originally
a servant of Lady Huntingdon, was one of Wesley’s first
preachers, but afterwards left the work. Taylor, however, was
the means of converting Samuel Deacon, an agricultural
labourer; and the two combined were the instruments, in
the hands of God, of raising up a number of churches in
Yorkshire and the midland counties, which, in 1770, were
organised into the New Connexion of General Baptists; and
that Connexion, seventy years afterwards, in 1840, comprised
113 churches, having 11,358 members, a foreign missionary
society, and two theological academies.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday-schools</i> are now an important appendage of every
church, and have been a benefit to millions of immortal souls;
but it deserves to be mentioned that Hannah Ball, a young
Methodist lady, had a Methodist Sunday-school at High
Wycombe fourteen years before Robert Raikes began his at
Gloucester; and that Sophia Cooke, another Methodist, who
afterwards became the wife of Samuel Bradburn, was the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
who suggested to Raikes the Sunday-school idea, and
actually marched with him, at the head of his troop of
ragged urchins, the first Sunday they were taken to the
parish church.</p>

<p>The first <i>British Bible Society</i> that existed, “The Naval
and Military,” was projected by George Cussons, and
organised by a small number of his Methodist companions.
The <i>London Missionary Society</i> originated in an appeal from
Melville Horne, who, for some years, was one of Wesley’s
itinerant preachers, and then became the successor of Fletcher
as vicar of Madeley. The <i>Church Missionary Society</i> was
started by John Venn, the son of Henry Venn the Methodist
clergyman. The first <i>Tract Society</i> was formed by John
Wesley and Thomas Coke, in 1782, seventeen years before the
organisation of the present great Religious Tract Society in
Paternoster Row—a society, by the way, which was instituted
chiefly by Rowland Hill, and two or three other Calvinistic
Methodists. It is believed that the first <i>Dispensary</i> that the
world ever had was founded by Wesley himself in connection
with the old Foundery, in Moorfields. The <i>Strangers’ Friend
Society</i>, paying, every year, from forty to fifty thousand visits
to the sick poor of London, and relieving them as far as
possible, is an institution to which Methodism gave birth in
1785.</p>

<p><i>Building churches</i> is one of the great features of the age.
Unfortunately, England has had no religious worship census
since 1851; but even then, according to the tables of Horace
Mann, Esq., Methodism had, in England and Wales only,
11,835 places of worship, with 2,231,017 sittings. In America,
according to the census of 1860, Methodism nine years ago
provided church accommodation for 6,259,799, which was two
and a quarter millions more than was provided by any other
church whatever.</p>

<p>The <i>public press</i> is one of the most powerful institutions of
the day. England has four Methodist newspapers; Ireland,
one; France, one; Germany, one; India, one; China, one;
Australia, two; Canada and British America, five; and the
United States about fifty.</p>

<p>Let the reader think of twelve millions of people at present
enjoying the benefits of Methodist instruction; let him think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of Methodism’s 21,875 ordained ministers, and of its tens of
thousands of lay preachers; let him think of the immense
amount of its church property, and of the well-nigh countless
number of its church publications; let him think of millions
of young people in its schools, and of its missionary agents
almost all the wide world over; let him think of its incalculable
influence upon other churches, and of the unsectarian
institutions to which it has given rise; and then let him say
whether the bold suggestion already made is not strictly true,
viz., that “<i>Methodism is the greatest fact in the history of the
church of Christ</i>.”</p>

<p>Here we have an immensely ramified church organisation,
everywhere preaching the same momentous doctrines, and
aiming at the same great purpose. A day never passes without
numbers of its converts being admitted into heaven; and
without many a poor wayward wanderer being brought by it
into the fold of Christ on earth. Thousands of its temples are
daily open; and “prayer,” by its churches, in one quarter of
the globe or in another, is “made continually.” It has belted
the entire planet with its myriad agents, who—in English,
French, Dutch, German, and Italian; in the various dialects
and tongues of Africa, India, and China; and in the newly
formed languages of the Feegee and the Friendly Islands—are
calling to the nations, “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come
ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy,
and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and
without price.”</p>

<p>In England, it has had much to do with the almost incredible
changes that have taken place in English society during the
last hundred years. In Ireland, with Popery so rampant, a
people so poor, and emigration so vast, it has some five or six
hundred chapels, besides having many hundreds of small
congregations in cottages, court-houses, market-places, and
village-greens. In Australia, it has more church sittings than
any other Christian community, the Church of England not
excepted; and has, at least, one twelfth of the colonists attending
its places of religious worship. In America, it has
become the dominant popular faith of the country, with its
standard planted in every city, town, and almost every village
of the land, and is building chapels at the rate of nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
two every day.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the early period of its history, it had its
fair share of persecution, and was, to an extent sufficient one
would think to satisfy its founders, pelted and hooted by
vulgar mobs, mistreated by magistrates and courts, reviled
by religionists, and assailed by swarms of pamphleteers; it
has had no national endowments, and has had no favour from
parliamentary legislation; it has had no assistance from the
State, and has been looked upon with supercilious contempt by
what, in England, is called “the Church;” and yet despite all
this, there is hardly a nation where its influence has not been
felt; and instead of finding it maimed and lame and injured
by fighting its past battles and winning its past victories; or
weak and palsied and inactive on account of approaching
age, it has never been more vigorous, by the blessing of God,
than it is at present; and is putting into motion an amount
of machinery the ultimate results of which no man’s mind can
grasp.</p>

<p>Is all this concerning Methodism strictly true? We believe
it is, and hence we believe that the life of Methodism’s
founder is a subject well worth knowing. Who was he?
What was he? Who were his companions? When and
where and how did he pass his time? We will try to
show.</p>

THE REV. JOHN WESLEY, M.A.</p>
<hr class="small" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />

<small><i>WESLEY AT HOME, AT SCHOOL, AND AT COLLEGE.</i><br />

<small>1703-1725.</small></small></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOHN WESLEY was born at Epworth, in the county
of Lincoln, on the 17th of June, 1703,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and was the son
of Samuel and Susannah Wesley, the former being the learned,
laborious, and godly rector of the Epworth parish from about
the year 1696 to his death in 1735. The Wesley family
consisted of nineteen children, but, of these, nine died in
infancy. The name of one of the dead infants was John,
and the name of another Benjamin; and when the subject
of this biography was born, his mother united the two names
by calling him John Benjamin. Second names are of little
use, and are often troublesome, and probably for this reason
Wesley’s second name was one which he never used.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>When Wesley was born, Queen Anne was commencing the
twelve years of English sovereignty which some have regarded
as the Augustan age of English learning. War was
raging on the continent, and, at home, an embittered fight was
being fought between fiery Churchmen and fierce Dissenters.
Anne warmly favoured the high church party; and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
augment Church livings, gave out of the royal income “the
first-fruits and the tenths,” amounting to £16,000 a year.
While Wesley was yet an infant, the Whigs raised the cry of
“the Church in danger,” but Parliament passed a resolution
that the cry was unfounded, and that those who gave it birth
were enemies to the queen, the Church, and the kingdom.
Five years after this, Dr. Sacheverell preached his firebrand
sermon in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and threw the nation into
a state of unparalleled excitement, the ultimate result of
which was, the Tories became more powerful than ever; and
Queen Anne, in meeting her Parliament in 1710, no longer
condescended to use the word <i>toleration</i> in reference to
Dissenters, but spoke of <i>indulgence</i> to be allowed “to scrupulous
consciences,” while, after a long continued struggle,
the high church party succeeded in passing the obnoxious
bill against occasional conformity. All this occurred during
Wesley’s childhood.</p>

<p>At the time of Wesley’s birth, his brother Samuel was a
sprightly boy, thirteen years of age, and a few months afterwards
was sent to Westminster School, where he became
distinguished for his scholarship and genius, and soon obtained
a host of literary friends, from Lord Oxford, the Mecænas of
his age, down to Addison, Atterbury, Pope, and Prior. Emilia
Wesley, so gifted and so beautiful, was a year younger than
Samuel, and was developing her exquisite sensibility and
taste under the mental and moral cultivation of her mother.
The ill-fated Susannah was a frolicsome child, eight years old.
Mary, already deformed by an early sickness and the carelessness
of her nurse, had arrived at the age of seven, and was
fast becoming the favourite of her father’s family. The almost
unequalled Mehetabel was six, and was so advanced in learning
that two years afterwards she read the New Testament in
Greek. Anne was yet an infant; and Martha, Charles, and
Keziah were still unborn.</p>

<p>In the year of Wesley’s nativity, his father was writing his
“History of the Old and New Testament, in Verse;” and
also had the pleasure or mortification (we hardly know which)
of having his pamphlet on Dissenting academies surreptitiously
published by a man to whom it had long before been
sent as a private letter. Before Wesley was three years old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
his father was ruthlessly thrust into gaol for debt; and before
he was six the parsonage was destroyed by fire. When the
fire occurred, his brother Charles was an infant not two
months old, and he, with John, three of their sisters, and their
nurse, were all in the same room, and fast asleep. Being
aroused, the nurse seized Charles, and bid the others follow.
The three sisters did as they were bidden, but John was left
sleeping. The venerable rector counted heads, and found
John was wanting. At the same instant, a cry was heard.
The frantic father tried to ascend the burning stairs, but
found it to be impossible. He then dropped upon his knees in
the blazing hall, and despairing of the rescue of his child,
commended him to God. Meanwhile John had mounted a
chest and was standing at the bedroom window. Quick
as thought, one man placed himself against the wall, and
another stood upon his shoulders, and just a moment before
the roof fell in with a fearful crash the child was rescued
through the window, and safely “plucked as a brand from the
burning” house.</p>

<p>Our information respecting Wesley’s childhood is extremely
limited. If we strip off all the luxuriant verbiage in which
imaginative writers have indulged, the naked facts are the
following.</p>

<p>Wesley, like all the other members of his father’s family,
was indebted for his elementary education to his mother.
The principles upon which she acted were unique. When the
child was one year old, he was taught to fear the rod, and, if
he cried at all, to cry in softened tones. Wesley long afterwards,
in his sermon on the education of children, enforces
his mother’s practice, urging parents never to give a child a
thing for which it cries, on the ground that to do so would be
a recompence for crying, and he would certainly cry again.</p>

<p>Another of Mrs. Wesley’s principles of action was to limit
her children to three meals a day. Eating and drinking
between meals was strictly prohibited. All the children were
washed and put to bed by eight o’clock, and, on no account,
was a servant to sit by a child till it fell asleep.</p>

<p>The whole of the Wesley children were taught the Lord’s
Prayer as soon as they could speak, and repeated it every
morning and every night. Rudeness was never seen amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
them; and on no account were they allowed to call each other
by their proper names without the addition of brother or sister,
as the case might be. Six hours a day were spent at school;
and loud talking, playing, and running into the yard, garden,
or street, without permission, was rigorously forbidden. None
of them, except Kezzy, was taught to read till five years old,
and then only a single day was allowed wherein to learn the
letters of the alphabet, great and small—a task which all of
them accomplished except Mary and Anne, who were a day
and a half before they knew them perfectly. Psalms were
sung every morning when school was opened, and also every
night when the duties of the day were ended. In addition
to all this, at the commencement and close of every day,
each of the elder children took one of the younger and read
the Psalms appointed for the day and a chapter in the Bible,
after which they severally went to their private devotions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley, assisted by her husband, seems to have been
the sole instructor of her daughters, and also of her sons,
until the latter were sent to school in London; and never was
there a family of children who did their teacher greater credit.</p>

<p>From early childhood, John was remarkable for his sober
and studious disposition, and seemed to feel himself answerable
to his reason and his conscience for everything he did.
He would do nothing without first reflecting on its fitness and
propriety. If asked, out of the common way of meals, to
have, for instance, a piece of bread or fruit, he would answer
with the coolest unconcern, “I thank you; I will think of it.”
To argue about a thing seemed instinctive, and was carried
to such a length that on one occasion his father almost chid
him, saying, “Child, you think to carry everything by dint of
argument; but you will find how little is ever done in the
world by close reasoning.” “I profess, sweetheart,” said the
rector in a pet to Mrs. Wesley, “I profess, sweetheart, I think
our Jack would not attend to the most pressing necessities of
nature, unless he could give a reason for it.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>With all this meditative reasoning, there was mixed devotion.
It is a remarkable fact, scarce paralleled, that such
was his consistency of conduct, that his father admitted him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
to the communion table when he was only eight years old;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and he himself informs us that, until he was about the age of
ten, he had not sinned away that “washing of the Holy Ghost,”
which he received in baptism.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Between the age of eight and nine the small-pox attacked
him; but he bore the terrible affliction with manly and Christian
fortitude. At the time, his father was in London, and his
mother writing him remarks: “Jack has borne his disease
bravely, like a man, and indeed like a Christian, without
complaint.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>This is all that is known respecting Wesley during his
childhood years at Epworth. Imagination might conjure up
his early thinkings, passions, and attachments, the localities
he loved to visit, and the sports, fun, and frolic in which he
occasionally indulged; but history, on such subjects, is entirely
silent; and for want of its honest statements we look at him
in the grave and sober aspect in which facts present him.</p>

<p>While yet a child, only ten and a half years old, Wesley
passed from under the tutelage of his accomplished mother,
and became a pupil at the Charterhouse, London. For his
son’s admission into this distinguished school, the Epworth
rector was indebted to the friendly services of the Duke of
Buckingham, at that time the Lord Chamberlain of the royal
household.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The privilege was great, and, to the day of his death, John
Wesley loved the place of his early education, and was
accustomed to walk through its courts and grounds once every
year. He was not without hardships; but he bore them
bravely. Among other acts of cruelty, the elder boys were
accustomed, in addition to their own share of animal food, to
take by force that which was apportioned to the younger
scholars; and, in consequence of this, for a considerable part
of the five years that young Wesley spent at the Charterhouse,
the only solid food he got was bread. There was one
thing, however, which contributed to his general flow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
health,—namely, his invariably carrying out a strict command
which his father gave him, to run round the Charterhouse
garden three times every morning. It is good for a man “to
bear the yoke in his youth,” and Wesley learned, as a boy,
to suffer wrongfully with a cheerful fortitude, and to submit
to the cruel exactions of his elder tyrants without acquiring
either the cringing of a slave or a despot’s imperious temper.</p>

<p>Wesley entered the school as the poor child of an impoverished
parish priest, and had to endure wrongs and insults
neither few nor small; but, though he was only sixteen years
of age when he left, he had, by his energy of character, his
unconquerable patience, his assiduity, and his progress in
learning, acquired a high position among his fellows. An old
Methodist pamphlet<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> relates an anecdote, to the effect that
the Rev. A. Tooke,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> master of the school, was struck with
the fact that, though Wesley was remarkably advanced in his
studies, yet he constantly associated with the inferior classes,
and was accustomed to harangue a number of the smaller
boys surrounding him. On one occasion Tooke broke in
upon him in the midst of an oration, and interrupted him, by
desiring him to follow him into a private room. Wesley reluctantly
obeyed, and the master, addressing him, asked how
it was that he was so often found among the boys of the lower
forms, and sought not the company of the bigger boys, who
were his equals? To which the young orator replied, “Better
to rule in hell than to serve in heaven.”</p>

<p>This story was given by “an old member of society,” on
what he calls “the most authentic authority,” for the purpose
of showing that Wesley, even as a boy, was ambitious. Be it
so. What then? Is ambition always, and under all circumstances,
a thing to be denounced? Ambition is widely
different from vanity, a paltry passion of petty minds; neither
is it necessarily accompanied with the use of improper means to
attain its object. Ambition is common to the human species.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
There are but few without it, and who are not desirous of
distinguishing themselves in the circle in which they live.
You see the passion in the aristocratic noble toiling after a distinction
which he desires to win; and you equally see it in the
poorest mechanic, who strives to surround himself with poor
admirers, and who delights in the superiority which he enjoys
over those who are, in some respects, beneath him. Besides, as
a rule, a man’s ambition is always in correspondence with his
other tastes, and faculties, and powers. Dr. Johnson wisely
remarks, that “Providence seldom sends any into the world
with an inclination to attempt great things, who have not
abilities likewise to perform them;” and Addison, an equally
thoughtful student of human nature, observes that “Men of
the greatest abilities are most fired with ambition; and, on
the contrary, mean and narrow minds are the least actuated
by it.” To account for this may be difficult, but none will
deny its truth. Perhaps the difference may be occasioned by a
man’s consciousness of his own capacities making him despair
of attaining positions which others reach; or perhaps, which
is more likely still, Providence, in the very framing of his
mind, has freed him from a passion, which would be useless to
the world, and a torment to himself.</p>

<p>On such grounds, then, we are quite prepared to argue
that, even allowing the above anonymous story to be strictly
true, and allowing also that it proves that Wesley as a boy
was animated with ambition, there is nothing in it which,
for a moment, detracts from Wesley’s honour and honest
fame.</p>

<p>We wish that this were the only thing to be alleged against
him during his Charterhouse career. Unfortunately there is
another fact far more serious; for Wesley, while at this seat
of learning, lost the religion which had marked his character
from the days of infancy. He writes concerning this period
of his history: “Outward restraints being removed, I was
much more negligent than before, even of outward duties, and
almost continually guilty of outward sins, which I knew to be
such, though they were not scandalous in the eye of the world.
However, I still read the Scriptures, and said my prayers
morning and evening. And what I now hoped to be saved
by was,—1. Not being so bad as other people. 2. Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
still a kindness for religion. And, 3. Reading the Bible,
going to church, and saying my prayers.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Terrible is the danger when a child leaves a pious home for
a public school. John Wesley entered the Charterhouse a
saint, and left it a sinner.</p>

<p>It was during his residence at this celebrated school, that
the mysterious and preternatural voices were heard in his
father’s house. The often told story need not be repeated;
but there can be no question that its influence upon himself
was powerful and important. He took the trouble of obtaining
minute particulars from his mother, from his four sisters,
Emily, Mary, Susannah, and Anne, and from Robin Brown.
He likewise transcribed his father’s diary, containing an
account of the disturbances;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> thereby showing the intense
interest he felt in the affair. In fact, it would seem that, from
this period, Wesley was a firm believer in ghosts and apparitions.
In his twentieth year, we find him writing to his
mother, in the gravest manner possible, concerning what he
calls “one of the most unaccountable stories he had ever
heard;”—namely, that of a lad in Ireland, who ever and anon
made an involuntary pilgrimage through the aerial regions,
and feasted with demigods <i>in nubibus</i>. In the same letter,
Wesley relates an adventure of his own; for, while walking a
few days previously in the neighbourhood of Oxford, he had
observed a forlorn looking house, which he found was unoccupied
by mortals because it was haunted by ghosts. Wesley
tells his mother that he purposes to visit this forsaken dwelling,
and to assure himself whether what he had heard was
true. He further relates that a Mr. Barnesley, and two other
of his fellow-students, had recently seen an apparition in a
field adjoining Oxford, and that it had since been ascertained
that Barnesley’s mother died in Ireland at the very moment
when the spectre had been witnessed.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Thus, at this early period of his history, Wesley’s mind,
wisely or unwisely, superstitiously or otherwise, was full of the
supernatural; and to the calm judgment of his philosophic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
mother he submits his facts for her opinion. Three weeks
afterwards she wrote:<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jacky</span>,—The story of Mr. Barnesley has afforded me many
curious speculations. I do not doubt the fact; but I cannot understand
why these apparitions are permitted. If they were allowed to speak to us,
and we had strength to bear such converse,—if they had commission to
inform us of anything relating to their invisible world that would be of
any use to us in this,—if they would instruct us how to avoid danger, or
put us in a way of being wiser and better, there would be sense in it; but
to appear for no end that we know of, unless to frighten people almost out
of their wits, seems altogether unreasonable.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was not a solution of Wesley’s difficulty. It was
rather making mystery more mysterious. The young student
was full of anxious inquiry. Isaac Taylor thinks that the
strange Epworth episode so laid open Wesley’s faculty of
belief, that ever after a right of way for the supernatural was
opened through his mind; and, to the end of life, there was
nothing so marvellous that it could not freely pass where
“Old Jeffrey” had passed before it. Taylor adds: “Wesley’s
most prominent infirmity was his wonder-loving credulity;
from the beginning to the end of his course this weakness
ruled him.” Other opportunities will occur of testing the
truthfulness of Taylor’s statement; but here it may be observed,
that for young Wesley to have regarded the noises at
Epworth with indifference would have been irreligious and
irrational. A metaphysician, vain of his philosophic powers,
like Isaac Taylor, may “deal with occult folk, such as Jeffrey,
huffingly and disrespectfully;” and may pretend to “catch
in the Epworth ghost a glimpse of an idiotic creature” belonging
to some order of invisible beings “not more intelligent
than apes or pigs,” and which, by some “mischance, was
thrown over its boundary, and obtained leave to disport itself
among things palpable, and went to the extent of its tether
in freaks of bootless mischief;” but, in broaching such a
theory, Isaac Taylor, wishing to be witty, makes himself
ridiculous. John Wesley believed the noises to be supernatural;
and Southey, as great an authority as Taylor,
defends his belief; and argues that such occurrences have a
tendency to explode the fine-spun theories of men who deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
another state of being, and to bring them to the conclusion
that there are more things in heaven and earth than are
dreamt of in their philosophy. We have little doubt that the
Epworth noises deepened and most powerfully increased
Wesley’s convictions of the existence of an unseen world; and,
in this way, exercised an important influence on the whole of
his future life. His notion,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that the disturbance was occasioned
by a messenger of Satan, sent to buffet his father for
a rash vow alleged to have been made fifteen years before,
has been shown to be utterly unfounded;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but the impressions
it produced, or rather strengthened, respecting invisible
realities, were of the utmost consequence in moulding his
character, and in making him one of the most earnest preachers
of the Christian’s creed that ever lived.</p>

<p>During Wesley’s residence at the Charterhouse, his brother
Samuel was the head usher of Westminster School; and in
1719, Wesley seems, for a time, to have become his brother’s
guest. Charles was now a pupil under Samuel’s tuition; and
the latter, writing to his father, says: “My brother Jack, I
can faithfully assure you, gives you no manner of discouragement
from breeding your third son a scholar. Jack is a brave
boy, learning Hebrew as fast as he can.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In the following year, Wesley was elected to Christ Church,
Oxford, one of the noblest colleges in that illustrious seat of
learning, and here he continued until after his ordination in
1725. In reference to this period, he writes: “I still said my
prayers, both in public and private; and read, with the Scriptures,
several other books of religion, especially comments on
the New Testament. Yet I had not all this while so much as
a notion of inward holiness; nay, went on habitually and, for
the most part, very contentedly, in some or other known sin;
though with some intermission and short struggles, especially
before and after the holy communion, which I was obliged to
receive thrice a year.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Such was Wesley during the first five years he spent at
Oxford. He maintained the reputation for scholarship which
he had acquired at school; but there was no alteration in his
moral and religious character. He said his prayers and read
good books, as perhaps most Oxford students did; but, like
others, he lived in sin, even habitually, except about thrice a
year, when he was compelled to receive the sacrament. No
doubt, like all the Wesley family, he was a gay and sprightly
companion, and full of wit and humour. He began to amuse
himself occasionally with writing verses, a specimen of which
is given by Dr. Whitehead and is reproduced by Joseph
Nightingale. The verses are six in number, and are merely
the translation of a Latin poem respecting a young lady to
whom he gives the name of Cloe. As Juno had a favourite
peacock and Venus a favourite dove, so Cloe had a favourite
flea, whose bliss in being allowed to crawl over the young
lady’s person the poet makes it his business to describe.
Henry Moore is angry with Dr. Whitehead for having given
the verses publicity; but certainly without a cause. Had the
piece been written by Wesley in advanced life it might have
deserved censure; but being written when he was scarcely
beyond his teens, it is only what a smart young fellow, full of
vivacity, might be expected to produce.</p>

<p>When Wesley went to Oxford his health was far from being
vigorous and robust. He was frequently troubled with bleeding
at the nose. In a letter to his mother, in 1723, he tells
her that lately, while walking in the country, he had bled so
violently that he was almost choked, nor could he at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
abate the hæmorrhage till he stripped himself and leaped into
the river.</p>

<p>He also had to struggle with financial difficulty, and was
not unfrequently in debt. He sometimes had to borrow; and,
more than once, when requesting that his sisters would write
to him, playfully remarks, that, though he was “so poor, he
would be able to spare the postage for a letter now and then.”
His friends were kind to him, and his tutors were considerate.
Soon after his entrance, his tutor, Mr. Wigan, retired to one
of his country livings, and was succeeded by Mr. Sherman,
who kindly told him that he would make his fees as low as
possible.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Of course he had the £40 per annum, which
belonged to him as a Charterhouse scholar; but this, with
the utmost economy, was hardly sufficient to meet all the
expenses of a young Oxford student. These financial
embarrassments are often referred to in the subsequent correspondence.</p>

<p>The following is from an unpublished letter, written by his
mother.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Wroote</span>, <i>August 19, 1724</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jack</span>,—I am uneasy because I have not heard from you. I
think you don’t do well to stand upon points, and to write only letter for
letter. Let me hear from you often, and inform me of the state of your
health, and whether you have any reasonable hopes of being out of debt.
I am most concerned for the good, generous man that lent you ten pounds,
and am ashamed to beg a month or two longer, since he has been so kind
as to grant us so much time already. We were amused with your uncle’s
coming from India; but I suppose these fancies are laid aside. I wish
there had been anything in it, for then perhaps it would have been in my
power to have provided for you. But if all things fail, I hope God will
not forsake us. We have still His good providence to depend on, which
has a thousand expedients to relieve us beyond our view.</p>

<p>“Dear Jack, be not discouraged; do your duty; keep close to your
studies, and hope for better days. Perhaps, notwithstanding all, we shall
pick up a few crumbs for you before the end of the year.</p>

<p>“Dear Jacky, I beseech Almighty God to bless thee!</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Susannah Wesley.</span>”<br />
</p>

<p>The following also, from another unpublished letter by his
mother, refers to the same subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Wroote</span>, <i>September 10, 1724</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jacky</span>,—I am nothing glad that Mr.—— has paid himself out
of your exhibition; for though I cannot hope, I do not despair, of my
brother’s coming, or, at least, remembering me where he is.</p>

<p>“The small-pox has been very mortal at Epworth most of this summer.
Our family have all had it except me, and I hope God will preserve me
from it.</p>

<p>“I heartily wish you were in orders, and could come and serve as one of
your father’s curates. Then I should see you often, and could be more
helpful to you than it is possible to be at this distance.”</p>
</div>

<p>We subjoin an extract from another letter, written shortly
after the above, and for the first time published in the <i>Wesleyan
Times</i> of January 29, 1866.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">John Wesley to his Mother.</span></p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Oxon</span>, <i>November 1, 1724</i>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,—We are most of us now very healthy at Oxford,
which may be in some measure owing to the frosty weather we have
had lately. Fruit is so very cheap that apples may be had almost for
fetching; and other things are both plentiful and good. We have, indeed,
something bad as well as good, for a great many rogues are about
the town, insomuch that it is exceedingly unsafe to be out late at night.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, standing at the door of a coffee-house
about seven in the evening, had no sooner turned about, but his cap and
wig were snatched off his head, and, though he followed the thief a great
distance, he was unable to recover them. I am pretty safe from such
gentlemen; for unless they carried me away, carcass and all, they would
have but a poor purchase.</p>

<p>“The chief piece of news with us is concerning the famous Jack Sheppard’s
escape from Newgate, which is indeed as surprising as most stories
I have heard.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have seen the famous Dr. Cheyne’s ‘Book of Health
and Long Life,’ which is, as he says he expected, very much cried down
by the physicians. He refers almost everything to temperance and exercise,
and supports most things with physical reasons. He entirely condemns
eating anything salt or high-seasoned, as also pork, fish, and stall-fed
cattle; and recommends for drink two pints of water and one of wine
in twenty-four hours, with eight ounces of animal, and twelve of vegetable
food in the same time. The book is chiefly directed to studious and
sedentary persons.</p>

<p>“I should have writ before now had I not had an unlucky cut across
my thumb, which almost jointed it, but is now nearly cured. I should be
exceedingly glad to keep a correspondence with my sister Emily if she
were willing, for I believe I have not heard from her since I have been at
Oxford. I have writ once or twice to my sister Sukey too, but have not
had an answer either from her or my sister Hetty, from whom I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
more than once desired the Poem of the Dog. I should be glad to hear
how things go on at Wroote, which I now remember with more pleasure
than Epworth; so true it is, at least in me, that the persons, not the
place, make home so pleasant.</p>

<p>“The scantiness of my paper obliges me to conclude with begging
yours and my father’s blessing on</p>

<p class="psig">“Your dutiful son,<br />

“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”</p>
<p>
“For Mrs. Wesley, at Wroote,</p>
<p class="center">
“To be left at the Post-office, in Bawtry, Nottinghamshire.”
</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Cheyne, mentioned in the preceding letter, was educated
at Edinburgh, where his habits were temperate and sedentary;
but, proceeding to London, he associated with a number of
young gentry, to retain whose friendship it was necessary to
indulge to the utmost in table luxuries. The result was,
Cheyne became nervous, scorbutic, short-breathed, lethargic
and listless; and was so enormously fat as to be nearly thirty-three
stones in weight. His life became an intolerable burden,
and, to cure himself, he adopted a milk and vegetable diet, by
means of which he recovered his strength, activity, and cheerfulness.
He became the author of several interesting works,
one of which was the book just noticed. Wesley, to a
great extent, adopted Cheyne’s prescription, and forty-six
years after he read his book at Oxford, wrote: “How marvellous
are the ways of God! How has He kept me even
from a child! From ten to thirteen or fourteen, I had little
but bread to eat, and not great plenty of even that. I believe
this was so far from hurting me, that it laid the foundation of
lasting health. When I grew up, in consequence of reading
Dr. Cheyne, I chose to eat sparingly, and to drink water.
This was another great means of continuing my health, till I
was about seven-and-twenty. I then began spitting of blood,
which continued several years. A warm climate [Georgia]
cured this. I was afterwards brought to the brink of death
by a fever; but it left me healthier than before. Eleven years
after, I was in the third stage of a consumption; in three
months it pleased God to remove this also. Since that I have
known neither pain nor sickness, and am now healthier than
I was forty years ago.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Cheyne became one of Wesley’s
favourites, and no wonder. After reading his “Natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Method of Curing Diseases,” he designates it one of the most
ingenious books he had ever seen; but adds, “What epicure
will ever regard it? for the man talks against good eating
and drinking!”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Cheyne died in 1745, calmly giving up his
soul to God, says Wesley, without any struggle, either of
body or mind.</p>

<p>Except the statement, that his <i>carcass</i> was the only property
he had, Wesley makes not the least allusion, in the foregoing
letter, to his pecuniary embarrassments. Naturally enough,
his mother was more anxious than himself. Hence the following
letter, hitherto unpublished, written within a month
afterwards.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Wroote</span>, <i>November 24, 1724</i>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jacky</span>,—I have now three of your letters before me unanswered.
I take it very kindly that you write so often. I am afraid of
being chargeable, or I should miss few posts, it being exceeding pleasant
to me, in this solitude, to read your letters, which, however, would be
pleasing anywhere.</p>

<p>“Your disappointment, in not seeing us at Oxon, was not of such consequence
as mine in not meeting my brother in London; not but your
wonderful curiosities might excite a person of greater faith than mine to
travel to your museum to visit them. It is almost a pity that somebody
does not cut the wezand of that keeper to cure his lying so enormously.</p>

<p>“I wish you would save all the money you can conveniently spare, not
to spend on a visit, but for a wiser and better purpose,—to pay debts, and
make yourself easy. I am not without hope of meeting you next summer,
if it please God to prolong my mortal life. If you then be willing,
and have time allowed you to accompany me to Wroote, I will bear your
charges, as God shall enable me.</p>

<p>“I hope, at your leisure, you will oblige me with some more verses on
any, but rather on a religious subject.</p>

<p>“Dear Jack, I beseech Almighty God to bless you.</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Susannah Wesley.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Wesley’s brother, referred to in the foregoing letter,
was in the service of the East India Company; and, the public
prints having stated that he was returning to England in one
of the company’s ships, Mrs. Wesley proceeded to London to
await his arrival, and to welcome him. The information,
however, was untrue, and both she and her son John were
doomed to a disappointment. Samuel, at the time, had a
broken leg, and had invited John to meet his mother at West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>minster.
John jocosely congratulates Samuel, that, like the
Dutch seaman who broke his leg by a fall from the mainmast
of his ship, he might thank God that he had not broken
his neck also; and then he adds that his mother’s letter had
made him weep for joy, for the two things he most wished
for of almost anything in the world, were again to see his
mother, and to see Westminster.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Wesley was still in debt, a fact which gave his mother great
anxiety. His father also, as usual, was embarrassed, and yet,
though offended at his son’s want of thrift, did his utmost
to afford him help. The following are painfully interesting
letters, and one of them is now for the first time published—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>January 5, 1725.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Son</span>,—Your brother will receive £5 for you next Saturday, if
Mr. S—— is paid the £10 he lent you; if not, I must go to H——, but
I promise you I shan’t forget that you are my son, if you do not that I am</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Wroote</span>, <i>January 26, 1725</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Son</span>,—I am so well pleased with your decent behaviour, or, at
least, with your letters, that I hope I shall have no occasion to remember
any more some things that are past; and since you have now for some
time bit upon the bridle, I will take care hereafter to put a little honey
upon it, as oft as I am able; but then it shall be of my own mere motion,
as the last £5 was, for I will bear no rivals in my kingdom.</p>

<p class="center">
“Your affectionate father,</p>
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>Some will blame the writer for publishing such letters, on
the ground that they cast shadows on young Wesley’s character;
but it ought to be borne in mind that the work of a
biographer is not to hide facts, but to publish them. Why
such an unwillingness to look at the specks as well as sunshine
in John Wesley’s history? Is it necessary, in order to
establish the high position which has been assigned to Wesley,
that the reader should be made to think that from first to
last he was <i>sui generis</i>, and altogether free from the infirmities,
faults, and sins of ordinary men? If it were, we would
rather lower the position than pervert the facts; but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
maintain, that no such necessity exists. When we say, that
from the age of eleven to the age of twenty-two, Wesley
made no pretensions to be religious, and, except on rare
occasions, habitually lived in the practice of known sin, we
only say what is equally true of many of the greatest, wisest,
and most godly men that have ever lived. The fact is
humiliating, and ought to be deplored; but why hide it in
one case more than in another? Wesley soon became one of
the holiest and most useful men living; but, except the first ten
years of his childhood, he was up to the age of twenty-two,
by his own confession, an habitual, if not profane and flagrant
sinner; and to his sin, he added the inconvenient and harassing
infirmity of his honest but imprudent father, and thoughtlessly
contracted debts greater than he had means to pay.
His letters are without religious sentiments, and his life was
without a religious aim. We yield to no man living in our
high veneration of Wesley’s character; but, at the same time,
we cannot hide it from ourselves and others, that, being human,
he was frail, and, like all his fellows, had need to repent as in
dust and ashes, and to seek, through Christ, the forgiveness
of his sins and a change of heart.</p>

<p>But leaving this, we turn to another important matter.
There is no evidence to show, that, when Wesley went to
Oxford, he intended or wished to become a minister of the
Established Church; it might be so, but it might be otherwise.
It is true that, by obtaining ordination, he would
become entitled to one of the Church livings at the disposal
of the Charterhouse governors; but Wesley was far too noble
and too high principled to seek admission into so sacred
an office as the Christian ministry merely to secure for
himself a crust of bread. He might intend to devote himself,
like his brother Samuel, to tutorship; or he might contemplate
some other mode of maintenance. Certain it is, that it
was not until about the beginning of 1725, when he had been
more than four years at college, that he expressed a wish to
become a minister of Christ. The matter was properly submitted
to his parents, and both gave him the best advice they
could.</p>

<p>His father told him that his principal motive for entering
the ministry must be, not, “as Eli’s sons, to eat a piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
bread,” but the glory of God, and the good of men; and
that, as a qualification for its sacred functions, he ought to
have a thorough knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in their
original languages. He was, however, not in haste for his
going into orders, and would give him further advice at some
future time.</p>

<p>On February 23, 1725, his mother wrote to him as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jacky</span>,—The alteration of your temper has occasioned me
much speculation. I, who am apt to be sanguine, hope it may proceed
from the operations of God’s Holy Spirit, that by taking away your relish
of sensual enjoyments, He may prepare and dispose your mind for a more
serious and close application to things of a more sublime and spiritual
nature. If it be so, happy are you if you cherish those dispositions, and
now, in good earnest, resolve to make religion the business of your life;
for, after all, that is the one thing that strictly speaking is necessary, and all
things else are comparatively little to the purposes of life. I heartily wish
you would now enter upon a serious examination of yourself, that you may
know whether you have a reasonable hope of salvation; that is, whether
you are in a state of faith and repentance or not, which you know are the
conditions of the gospel covenant on our part. If you are, the satisfaction
of knowing it would abundantly reward your pains; if not, you will
find a more reasonable occasion for tears than can be met with in a
tragedy.</p>

<p>“Now I mention this, it calls to mind your letter to your father about
taking orders. I was much pleased with it, and liked the proposal well;
but it is an unhappiness almost peculiar to our family, that your father
and I seldom think alike. I approve the disposition of your mind, and
think the sooner you are a deacon the better; because it may be an inducement
to greater application in the study of practical divinity, which I
humbly conceive is the best study for candidates for orders. Mr. Wesley
differs from me, and would engage you, I believe, in critical learning,
which, though accidentally of use, is in nowise preferable to the other. I
earnestly pray God to avert that great evil from you of engaging in
trifling studies to the neglect of such as are absolutely necessary. I dare
advise nothing: God Almighty direct and bless you! I have much to
say, but cannot write you more at present. I long to see you. We hear
nothing of H—— which gives us some uneasiness. We have all writ, but
can get no answer. I wish all be well—Adieu!</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Susannah Wesley.</span>”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>Three weeks after this, his father wrote to him, saying that
he was now inclined to his entering orders without delay, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
exhorting him to prayer and study in reference to such a
step, promising that he would struggle hard to obtain the
money for the needful expenses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his sister Emilia wrote him a long letter, from
which the following extracts are taken:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Wroote</span>, <i>April 7, 1725</i>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,—Whether you will be engaged before thirty, or not,
I cannot determine; but, if my advice be worth listening to, never
engage your affections before your worldly affairs are in such a posture
that you may marry soon. The contrary practice has proved very pernicious
in our family. I know you are a young man encompassed with
difficulties, and have passed through many hardships already, and
probably must through many more before you are easy in the world; but,
believe me, if ever you come to suffer the torment of a hopeless love, all
other afflictions will seem small in comparison of this.</p>

<p>“I know not when we have had so good a year, both at Wroote and at
Epworth, as this year; but instead of saving anything to clothe my
sister or myself, we are just where we were. A noble crop has almost all
gone, beside Epworth living, to pay some part of those infinite debts my
father has run into, which are so many, that were he to save £50 a year,
he would not be clear in the world this seven years. One thing I warn you
of: let not my giving you this account be any hindrance to your affairs.
If you want assistance in any case, my father is as able to give it now as
any time these last ten years; nor shall we be ever the poorer for it.</p>

<p>“I have quite tired you now; pray be faithful to me. Let me have one
relation that I can trust. Never give a hint to any one of aught I write
to you; and continue to love your unhappy but affectionate sister,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Emilia Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley now began to apply himself with diligence to the
study of divinity. He writes: “When I was about twenty-two,
my father pressed me to enter into holy orders. At the
same time the providence of God directing me to Kempis’s
‘Christian’s Pattern,’ I began to see that true religion was
seated in the heart, and that God’s law extended to all our
thoughts as well as words and actions. I was, however,
angry at Kempis for being too strict; though I read him only
in Dean Stanhope’s translation. Yet I had frequently much
sensible comfort in reading him, such as I was an utter
stranger to before. Meeting likewise with a religious friend,
which I never had till now, I began to alter the whole form of
my conversation, and to set in earnest upon a new life. I set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
apart an hour or two a day for religious retirement. I
communicated every week. I watched against all sin, whether
in word or deed. I began to aim at, and to pray for, inward
holiness. So that now, doing so much and living so good
a life, I doubted not that I was a good Christian.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>What a confession! It was eleven years since Wesley left
the parental roof; but he never had a <i>religious friend</i> till
now. No wonder he had gone astray.</p>

<p>Having written to his mother, stating some of the difficulties
which he had found in Kempis, she, on the 8th June,
1725, sent him a long letter, which, however adapted to an
enlightened Christian, was useless, if not misleading, to an
anxious inquirer not yet converted. The entire letter is before
us, containing, besides a large amount of Christian casuistry,
some family affairs of painful interest. These we pass over,
and merely give an extract in reference to Kempis:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have Kempis by me; but have not read him lately. I cannot
recollect the passages you mention; but, believing you do him justice, I
do positively aver that he is extremely in the wrong in that impious, I
was about to say blasphemous, suggestion, that God, by an irreversible
decree, has determined any man to be miserable even in this world. His
intentions, as Himself, are holy, just, and good; and all the miseries
incident to men here or hereafter proceed from themselves. I take
Kempis to have been an honest weak man, that had more zeal than
knowledge.</p>

<p>“Your brother has brought us a heavy reckoning for you and Charles.
God be merciful to us all! Dear Jack, I earnestly beseech Almighty
God to bless you. Adieu!</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Susannah Wesley.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>Ten days after the date of his mother’s letter, he wrote to
her again, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>June 18, 1725.</i><br />

<p>“You have so well satisfied me as to the tenets of Thomas à Kempis,
that I have ventured to trouble you again on a more dubious subject. Dr.
Taylor, in his ‘Holy Living and Dying,’ says, ‘Whether God has forgiven
us or no, we know not; therefore, be sorrowful for ever having sinned.’
This seems to contradict his own words in the next section, where he
says that ‘by the Lord’s supper all the members are united to one another,
and to Christ the Head. The Holy Ghost confers on us the graces
necessary for, and our souls receive the seed of, an immortal life.’ Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
surely these graces are of not so little force as that we cannot perceive
whether we have them or not. If we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us
(which He will not do unless we are regenerate), certainly we must be
sensible of it. If we can never have any certainty of our being in a state
of salvation, good reason it is that every moment should be spent, not in
joy, but in fear and trembling; and then, undoubtedly, in this life we are of
all men the most miserable. God deliver us from such a fearful expectation
as this!”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We thus find young Wesley carefully reading Thomas à
Kempis and Jeremy Taylor, and groping after two of the
great doctrines which afterwards distinguished his ministry:
God’s love to <i>all</i>, and the privilege of living in a state of
conscious salvation. These and other topics puzzled him,
and yet he seemed to have an almost instinctive knowledge of
what is truth. We have seen his mother’s sentiments concerning
Kempis. His father, on the 14th of July following,
observes that though Kempis has gone to an extreme in
teaching the doctrine of self-mortification, yet, considering the
age in which he wrote, there was no need to be surprised
at this. And then he adds: “Making some grains of allowance,
he may be read to great advantage. Notwithstanding
all his superstition and enthusiasm, it is almost impossible to
peruse him seriously, without admiring, and in some measure
imitating, his heroic strains of humility and piety and
devotion.”</p>

<p>The books of Kempis and Taylor seem to have been the
first on practical divinity that Wesley read, and, to the day of
his death, were held in high esteem. Kempis’s “Pattern”
was one of the first books that Wesley published; and an
extract from Taylor’s work forms a part of his “Christian
Library.” In his estimation, Taylor was a man of the sublimest
piety, and one of the greatest geniuses on earth;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and Kempis is always spoken of in terms of high respect.
What were the results of Wesley’s reading?</p>

<p>1. To this incident we are indebted for Wesley’s long continued
record of the events and exercises of his daily life.
In the preface to his first journal, dated September 20,
1740, he states, that about fifteen years ago (1725), in pursuance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of an advice given by Bishop Taylor in his “Rules
for Holy Living and Dying,” he began to take a more
exact account than he had done before of the manner
wherein he spent his time, writing down how he had
employed every hour. The practice thus begun was uninterruptedly
continued until his death, and issued in giving to
the world one of the most interesting works in the English
language; a work not only containing the best history of the
great reformer, and of the rise and growth of the Methodist
movement, but sparkling with the most racy remarks respecting
men, books, places, science, witches, ghosts, and almost
everything with which the writer came in contact.</p>

<p>2. Another, and far more important result of reading
Kempis and Taylor, was an entire change of life. He writes
respecting Kempis’s “Pattern:” “When I met with it in 1726,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
the nature and extent of inward religion, the religion of the
heart, now appeared to me in a stronger light than ever it had
done before. I saw that giving even all my life to God (supposing
it possible to do this, and go no further) would profit
me nothing, unless I gave my heart, yea, all my heart, to
Him. I saw that simplicity of intention, and purity of affection,
one design in all we speak and do, and one desire ruling
all our tempers, are indeed the wings of the soul, without
which she can never ascend to God. I sought after this from
that hour.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Again, in reference to Taylor’s “Holy Living and Dying,”
he observes: “In reading several parts of this book, I was
exceedingly affected; that part in particular which relates to
purity of intention. Instantly I resolved to dedicate all my
life to God,—all my thoughts, and words, and actions,—being
thoroughly convinced there was no medium; but that every
part of my life (not some only) must either be a sacrifice to
God, or myself, that is, in effect, the devil.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have the turning-point in Wesley’s history.
It was not until thirteen years after this, that he received the
consciousness of being saved through faith in Christ; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
from this time, his whole aim was to serve God and his fellowmen,
and to get safe to heaven. No man could be more
sincere, earnest, devout, diligent, and self-denying; and yet,
during this lengthened period, he lived and laboured in a mist.</p>

<p>His father was £350 in debt; but was now resolved to do
his utmost to obtain ordination for his son. He urged him to
master St. Chrysostom and the articles; and sent his “Letter
to a Curate,” in manuscript, to assist him in his preparations;
and also wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln in his favour.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Meanwhile his mother tried to solve some of his scruples
respecting the article on predestination;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and wrote him a
long letter, not hitherto published, from which we give the
following extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“Wroote, <i>July 21, 1725</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jackey</span>,—Though I have a great deal of unpleasant business,
am infirm, and but slow of understanding, yet it is a pleasure to me to
correspond with you on religious subjects; and, if it be of the least advantage
to you, I shall greatly rejoice. I know little or nothing of Dr. Taylor’s
‘Holy Living and Dying,’ having not seen it for above twenty years; but
I think it is generally well esteemed. I cannot judge of the rules you
suppose impracticable; but I will tell you my thoughts of humility as
briefly as I can.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here follow her remarks on humility. She continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He is certainly right, that there is but one true repentance, for
repentance is a state not a transient act; and this state begins in a change
of the whole mind from evil to good, and contains, in some sense, all the
parts of a holy life.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Repentance, in Scripture, is said to signify the
whole of obedience, as faith often includes repentance, and all the subsequent
acts of religion: ‘Repent, and thy sins shall be forgiven thee;’
‘Believe, and thou shalt be saved.’ If, after this change, we fall into the
contrary state—a state of wilful impenitence—which is nothing less than
a total apostasy—the Scripture is plain; ‘There remaineth no more sacrifice
for sin;’ no place is left for repentance; for, by this formal renunciation
of our most holy faith, we ‘crucify afresh the Son of God, and put
Him to an open shame.’ But this is not the case of those who never were
converted; or of such who, having been converted, fall nevertheless sometimes
into their old sins, through the fault of their nature, or the stress of
temptation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t well understand what he means by saying, ‘Whether God has
forgiven us or no, we know not.’ If he intends such a certainty of pardon
as cannot possibly admit of the least doubt or scruple, he is infallibly in
the right; for such an absolute certainty we can never have till we come
to heaven. But if he means no more than that reasonable persuasion of
the forgiveness of sins, which a true penitent feels when he reflects on the
evidences of his own sincerity, he is certainly in the wrong, for such a firm
persuasion is actually enjoyed by man in this life.</p>

<p>“The virtues which we have by the grace of God acquired, are not of
so little force as he supposes; for we may surely perceive when we have
them in any good degree. But when our love to God, and faith in the
Lord Jesus are weak (for there is a great inequality in our lives); when,
though we strive against our sins, we have not so far overcome but that
we sometimes relapse into them again,—in such a case we shall be often
doubtful of our state. But when, by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, we
have made a considerable progress in religion, and when habits of virtue
are confirmed; when we find little disturbance from any exorbitant appetite,
and can maintain an even tenour of life,—we shall be easy, and free
from all torment, doubts, or fears of our future happiness; for perfect
love will cast out fears.</p>

<p>“I am entirely of your opinion, that whenever we worthily communicate,
with faith, humility, etc., our sins are forgiven, and will never rise in judgment
against us if we forsake them. The Scripture is so clear and express
in this case, that I think none can question the pardon of his sins if he
repent, except such as do not believe it.</p>

<p>“But if you would be free from fears and doubts concerning your future
happiness, every morning and evening commit your soul to Jesus Christ,
in a full faith in His power and will to save you. If you do this seriously
and constantly, He will take you under His conduct; He will guide you
by His Holy Spirit into the way of truth, and give you strength to walk
in it. He will dispose of the events of God’s general providence to your
spiritual advantage; and if, to keep you humble and more sensible of your
dependence on Him, He permit you to fall into lesser sins, be not discouraged;
for He will certainly give you repentance, and safely guide you
through all the temptations of this world, and, at the last, receive you to
Himself in glory.</p>

<p>“Your father has written lately to you about your business. I heartily
wish you success, for I am greatly troubled at your unhappy circumstances.
I can do nothing at present but pray for you. Dear Jack, I
beseech Almighty God to bless you.</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Susannah Wesley.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>Part of Wesley’s reply to his mother’s letter is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>July 29, 1725.</i>
</p>

<p>“That we can never be so certain of the pardon of our sins as to be
assured they will never rise up against us, I firmly believe. We know
that they will infallibly do so if ever we apostatize, and I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
satisfied what evidence there can be of our final perseverance, till we
have finished our course. But I am persuaded we may know if we are
now in a state of salvation, since that is expressly promised in the Holy
Scriptures to our sincere endeavours, and we are, surely, able to judge of
our own sincerity.</p>

<p>“What shall I say of predestination? An everlasting purpose of God
to deliver some from damnation, does, I suppose, exclude all from that
deliverance who are not chosen. And if it was inevitably decreed from
eternity that such a determinate part of mankind should be saved, and
none beside them, a vast majority of the world were only born to eternal
death, without so much as a possibility of avoiding it. How is this
consistent with either the Divine justice or mercy? Is it merciful to ordain
a creature to everlasting misery? Is it just to punish man for crimes
which he could not but commit? That God should be the author of sin
and injustice (which must, I think, be the consequence of maintaining
this opinion), is a contradiction to the clearest ideas we have of the
Divine nature and perfections.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If the ideas of Wesley and his mother, on the way of
attaining salvation, had been as scriptural as his ideas on
general redemption, both would have been in a holier and
happier frame of mind.</p>

<p>Wesley’s religion already made him the subject of contemptuous
sneers. Hence the following from his father:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Wroote</span>, <i>August 2, 1725</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Son</span>,—If you be what you write I shall be happy. As to the
gentlemen candidates you mention, does anybody think the devil is dead,
or asleep, or that he has no agents left? Surely virtue can bear being
laughed at. The Captain and Master endured something more for us
before He entered into glory, and unless we track His steps, in vain do we
hope to share that glory with Him.</p>

<p>“Nought else but blessing from your loving father,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Samuel Wesley</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley was still in doubt in reference to several matters
which had occurred to him during his late religious reading;
and to relieve his doubts, his mother sent him some of the
ablest letters she ever penned. The subjoined is taken from a
long epistle now before us, and only part of which has heretofore
been published:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Wroote</span>, <i>August 18, 1725</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jackey</span>,—Divine faith is an assent to whatever God has revealed
to us, because He has revealed it. And this is that virtue of faith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
which is one of the two conditions of our salvation by Jesus Christ. But
this matter is so fully and accurately explained by Bishop Pearson (under
‘I Believe’) that I shall say no more of it.</p>

<p>“I have often wondered that men should be so vain as to amuse
themselves with searching into the decrees of God, which no human
wit can fathom, and do not rather employ their time and powers in working
out their salvation. Such studies tend more to confound than to inform
the understanding, and young people had better let them alone. But
since I find you have some scruples concerning our article, Of Predestination,
I will tell you my thoughts of the matter. If they satisfy not, you
may desire your father’s direction, who is surely better qualified for
a casuist than I.</p>

<p>“The doctrine of predestination, as maintained by the rigid Calvinists,
is very shocking, and ought to be abhorred, because it directly charges the
most high God with being the author of sin. I think you reason well and
justly against it; for it is certainly inconsistent with the justice and
goodness of God to lay any man under either a physical or moral
necessity of committing sin, and then to punish him for doing it.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe that God, from eternity, has elected some to eternal
life; but then I humbly conceive that this election is founded on His
foreknowledge, according to Romans viii. 29, 30. Whom, in His eternal
prescience, God saw would make a right use of their powers, and accept of
offered mercy, He did predestinate and adopt for His children. And that
they may be conformed to the image of His only Son, He calls them to
Himself, through the preaching of the gospel, and, internally, by His Holy
Spirit; which call they obeying, repenting of their sins and believing in the
Lord Jesus, He justifies them, absolves them from the guilt of all their sins,
and acknowledges them as just and righteous persons, through the merits
and mediation of Jesus Christ. And having thus justified, He receives
them to glory—to heaven.</p>

<p>“This is the sum of what I believe concerning predestination, which I
think is agreeable to the analogy of faith; since it does in nowise
derogate from the glory of God’s free grace, nor impair the liberty of man.
Nor can it with more reason be supposed that the prescience of God is
the cause that so many finally perish, than that one knowing the sun will
rise to-morrow is the cause of its rising.”</p>
</div>

<p>John Wesley substantially adopted his mother’s predestinarian
views, as may be seen in his sermon on the text
which she expounds in the foregoing letter; but his notions of
that faith by which a sinner is justified were, at present, like
those of his mother, vague and general, and far from being
clear.</p>

<p>The time for Wesley’s ordination was now approaching,
and the money question again rose up like a spectre, and
required attention. His father writes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Bawtry</span>, <i>September 1, 1725</i>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Son</span>,—I came hither to-day because I cannot be at rest till
I make you easier. I could not possibly manufacture any money for
you here sooner than next Saturday. On Monday I design to wait
on Dr. Morley, and will try to prevail with your brother to return you £8
with interest. I will assist you in the charges for ordination, though I am
myself just now struggling for life. This £8 you may depend on the
next week, or the week after.</p>

<p class="center">

“<span class="smcap">Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>Difficulties were overcome, and Wesley, having prepared
himself with the most conscientious care for the ministerial
office, was ordained deacon on Sunday, September 19th, 1725.</p>

<small><i>WESLEY’S ORDINATION, ETC.</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1725

Age 22</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHAT was the state of things about the time of Wesley’s
ordination? Wesley entered the Charterhouse in
the year Queen Anne died. George I., Elector of Hanover,
took her place. Endless intrigues in favour of the Pretender
sprung up; and Bolingbroke fled to him on the Continent, and
became his Secretary of State. Ormond gave magnificent
fêtes at Richmond, and gathered around him the most fiery
of the Jacobites, and the most intolerant of the high church
party, till he also found it expedient to follow Bolingbroke’s
example, and secretly escape to France. The clergy, in many
instances, preached sermons and published pamphlets in which
the temper, orthodoxy, and religion of King George were not
painted in the brightest colours, and in which they hesitated
not to say that England would soon be eaten up by Hanoverian
rats and other foreign vermin. Rumours of invasion
and of insurrection became general, and, about a year after
George’s coronation, the Chevalier landed in Scotland, to
take possession of what he called his kingdom.</p>

<p>The history of this adventure is too well known to be repeated
here. Suffice it to observe, that Parliament set a price
on the Pretender’s head, by offering a reward of £100,000 for
his arrest. In Scotland, King George’s troops were put to live
in free quarters, in the houses and upon the estates of
Jacobites. In England, gaols were crowded with nonjuring
Protestants, high church divines, and Popish squires, monks,
and priests; while the Chevalier, like his poltroon father, fled
from danger, and left thousands of his hot-headed followers
to pay a fearful penalty for their rash adherence to him.
Plotters, however, still plotted; among the chief of whom was
Bishop Atterbury, the friend and patron of Wesley’s brother
Samuel. The prelate was arrested, was tried in the House
of Lords, was deprived of his bishopric, was banished from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
country, entered the service of the Pretender, and became his
confidential agent.</p>

<p>These were times of terrible upheaving, and, surrounded
by such commotions, young Wesley quietly pursued his
scholastic studies, first in the Charterhouse, London, and
afterwards in Christ Church College, Oxford. In the year in
which Wesley went to Oxford, the South Sea bubble burst,
and, by its gambling, knavish madness, the nation was involved
in the most disgraceful kind of bankruptcy. About
the same period, Parliament were discussing bills to authorize
bishops and county magistrates to summon Dissenting
ministers to quarter sessions to subscribe to a declaration of
the Christian faith; and, upon their refusal, to deprive them
of the benefit of the Act of Toleration; while, oddly enough,
at the same time, Walpole, the prime minister, was endeavouring
to satisfy the squeamish demand to omit from the
“affirmation” of the Quakers the words,—“In the presence
of Almighty God”—a demand which Atterbury resisted to
the uttermost, insisting that such an indulgence was not due
to “a set of people who were hardly Christians.”</p>

<p>Wesley was ordained a deacon by Bishop Potter, the son
of a Yorkshire linen-draper; a man of great talent, and immense
learning,—somewhat haughty and morose, and yet
highly esteemed by a great portion of his contemporaries,—a
high churchman, who maintained that episcopacy was of
Divine institution, and yet one who cherished a friendly feeling
towards the first Methodists, saying concerning them, “These
gentlemen are irregular; but they have done good; and I pray
God to bless them.” To the day of his death, Wesley held
Potter in high esteem, calling him “a great and good man”;
and, in a sermon written as late as the year 1787, mentioning
an advice which the bishop had given him half a century
before, and for which he had often thanked Almighty God,
namely, “That if he wished to be extensively useful, he must
not spend his time in contending for or against things of a
disputable nature, but in testifying against notorious vice, and
in promoting real, essential holiness.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>It is a somewhat remarkable circumstance that, just about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the time of Wesley’s ordination, Voltaire was expelled from
France, and fled to England, where he published his celebrated
“Henriade,” a work which was patronized by George
I., and which yielded a profit that laid the foundation of the
infidels future fortune. During a long life, he and Wesley
were contemporaneous, and, perhaps, of all the men then
living, none exercised so great an influence as the restless
philosopher and the unwearied minister of Christ. No men,
however, could be more dissimilar. Wesley, in person, was
beautiful; Voltaire was of a physiognomy so strange, and
lighted up with fire so half-hellish and half-heavenly, that it
was hard to say whether it was the face of a satyr or a man.
Wesley’s heart was filled with a world-wide benevolence;
Voltaire, though of gigantic mind, scarcely had a heart at
all,—an incarnation of avaricious meanness, and a victim to
petty passions. Wesley was the friend of all and the enemy
of none; Voltaire was too selfish to love, and when forced to
pay the scanty and ill-tempered homage which he sometimes
rendered, it was always offered at the shrine of rank and
wealth. Wesley had myriads who loved him; Voltaire had
numerous admirers, but probably not a friend. Both were
men of ceaseless labour, and almost unequalled authors; but
while the one filled the land with blessings, the other, by his
sneering and mendacious attacks against revealed religion,
inflicted a greater curse than has been inflicted by the
writings of any other author either before or since. The evangelist
is now esteemed by all whose good opinions are worth
having; the philosopher is only remembered to be branded
with well-merited reproach and shame.</p>

<p>Wesley’s first sermon was preached at South Leigh, a small
village three miles from Witney. Forty-six years afterwards
he preached in the same place, when there was one man
present who had been a member of his first congregation.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Another of his early sermons was delivered at Epworth,
January 11, 1726, at the funeral of John Griffith, a hopeful
young man, son of one of the Epworth parishioners. The
text was 2 Samuel xii. 23, and the subject of the brief sermon
was the folly of indulging grief, except on account of sin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Funeral sermons, in the common acceptation of the word, the
young preacher denounces, for they had been so often prostituted
to a mere flattery of the dead that now they were no
longer capable of serving good purposes. “It is of no service
to the dead,” says he, “to celebrate his actions, since he has
the applause of God and His holy angels, and his own conscience.
And it is of little use to the living, since he who
desires a pattern may find enough proposed as such in the
sacred writings.” For such reasons, Wesley, already laconic,
reduces all that he has to say of John Griffith into a single
sentence. “To his parents he was an affectionate, dutiful
son; to his acquaintance an ingenuous, cheerful, good-natured
companion; and to me a well-tried, sincere friend.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>In a little more than two months after the delivery of this
sermon, Wesley was elected fellow of Lincoln College.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
election took place March 17th, 1726. In this affair, his
brother Samuel rendered him considerable assistance; his
mother, with a full heart, thanked Almighty God for his
“good success;”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and his father wrote him as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Fellow Elect of Lincoln</span>,—I have done more than
I could for you. On your waiting on Dr. Morley<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> with this, he will pay
you £12. You are inexpressibly obliged to that generous man. The last
£12 pinched me so hard, that I am forced to beg time of your brother
Sam till after harvest, to pay him the £10 that you say he lent you.
Nor shall I have as much as that, perhaps not £5, to keep my family till
after harvest; and I do not expect that I shall be able to do anything for
Charles when he goes to the university. What will be my own fate God
only knows. <i>Sed passi graviora.</i> Wherever I am, my Jack is fellow of
Lincoln. I wrote to Dr. King, desiring leave for you to come one, two,
or three months into the country, where you shall be gladly welcome.
Keep your best friend fast; and, next to him, Dr. Morley; and have a
care of your other friends, especially the younger. All at present from
your loving father,</p>

<p class="psig">

</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Writing to his brother Samuel, Wesley says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Lincoln College, Oxon</span>, <i>April 4, 1726</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,—My father very unexpectedly, a week ago, sent
me a bill on Dr. Morley for £12, which he had paid to the rector’s use at
Gainsborough; so that now all my debts are paid, and the expenses of
my treat defrayed; and I have still above £10 remaining. If I could
have leave to stay in the country till my college allowance commences,
this money would abundantly suffice me till then.</p>

<p>“I never knew a college besides ours, whereof the members were so
perfectly well satisfied with one another, and so inoffensive to the other
part of the university. All the fellows I have yet seen are both well-natured
and well-bred; men admirably disposed as well to preserve
peace and good neighbourhood among themselves, as to preserve it
wherever else they have any acquaintance.</p>

“I am, etc.,</p>
<p class="psig">“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>The following, which was also addressed to his brother
Samuel, is amusing. Wesley was so poor that he could ill
afford to employ a barber to cut and dress his hair, even when
his mother wished it, and when he himself thought it might
improve his personal appearance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My mother’s reason for my cutting off my hair is because she fancies
it prejudices my health. As to my looks, it would doubtless mend my
complexion to have it off, by letting me get a little more colour, and
perhaps it might contribute to my making a more genteel appearance.
But these, till ill health is added to them, I cannot persuade myself to be
sufficient grounds for losing two or three pounds a year. I am ill enough
able to spare them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman says there are garrets, somewhere in Peckwater, to be
let for fifty shillings a year; that there are some honest fellows in
college, who would be willing to chum in one of them; and that, could
my brother but find one of these garrets, and get acquainted with
one of these honest fellows, he might possibly prevail upon him to join
in taking it; and then if he could but prevail upon some one else to give
him £7 a year for his own room, he would gain almost £6 a year clear, if
his rent were well paid. He appealed to me whether the proposal was
not exceedingly reasonable? But as I could not give him such an answer
as he desired, I did not choose to give him any at all.</p>

<p>“Leisure and I have taken leave of one another. I propose to be busy
as long as I live, if my health is so long indulged me. In health and
sickness I hope I shall ever continue with the same sincerity,</p>

<p>Charles Wesley had just removed from Westminster School
to the university, being elected to the same college as that
in which his brother had spent the last six years. John
obtained leave of absence from Lincoln College, and spent
the summer at Epworth and Wroote with his venerated
parents. Here he usually read prayers and preached twice
every sabbath; pursued his studies with the greatest
diligence; and conversed with his father and mother on
many of the chief topics of practical religion, noting in his
diary such of their rules and maxims as appeared to him
important.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> While here, he wrote his paraphrase on the
104th Psalm,—a production of genius fully showing that if
Wesley had cultivated his poetic talents he might easily have
attained to no inferior position among the bards of Britain.
The following is an extract:—</p>

<p>“Make poetry your diversion,”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> said Wesley’s mother, “but
not your business;” and because he acted on this advice his
poetical pieces are comparatively few. It is well known,
however, that some of the noblest hymns in the Wesleyan
hymn-book were written by John Wesley’s pen. What can
exceed, in poetic grandeur, the three hymns beginning with
the line:—</p>

<p class="center">
“Father of all, whose powerful voice,” etc.<br />

<p>Or the two hymns commencing with:—</p>

<p>Let it be granted that these and others were translations;
but still it must be ceded that the words, if not the thoughts,
are Wesley’s; and that never, in uninspired language, is God
adored and praised in loftier or more sacred strains than in
the singing of the hymns above mentioned. Apart from his
numerous hymn-books, Wesley, at different times, published
five volumes of poetry, and, to the day of his death, read it
with the richest relish.</p>

<p>Wesley returned to Oxford on the 21st of September, 1726,
and resumed his studies. His literary character was now
established at the university. All parties acknowledged him
to be a man of talents and of learning; while his skill in logic
was known to be remarkable. The result was, though he was
only in the twenty-third year of his age, and had not yet
taken a master’s degree, he was, within two months after his
return from Epworth, on November 7th, elected Greek lecturer
and moderator of the classes.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the year 1727, Wesley, in a letter,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
tells his mother that he had drawn up for himself a
scheme of studies, and had “perfectly come over to her
opinion, that there are many truths it is not worth while to
know. If we had a dozen centuries of life allowed us, we
might, perhaps, be pardoned for spending a little time upon
such curious trifles; but, with the small pittance of life we
have, it would be great ill husbandry to spend a considerable
part of it in what makes neither a quick nor a sure return.”
Wesley adds, that, about the time of his ordination, he had,
while watching with a college friend a young lady’s funeral,
attempted to make his friend a Christian. From that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
this youth was exceedingly serious; and a fortnight ago had
died of consumption. Wesley was with him three days before
his decease, and on the Sunday following, in accordance with
his friend’s desire while living, he did him the last good office
that he could by preaching his funeral sermon. Here was
<i>Wesley’s first convert</i>.</p>

<p>Another friend must be introduced, not so serious as the
sight of a funeral has a tendency to make us, but a sprightly
young collegian, more vivacious than religious, who, in 1729,
became one of the first four Methodists that met together to
read the Greek Testament,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and whose portrait occupies a
place in the large and beautiful engraving of “The Rev. John
Wesley and his Friends at Oxford.” The following letter is
valuable only as it tends to show that Wesley, and some of
his college friends, were not yet so intensely religious as they
became soon after.</p>

or impertinent expressions; but I am condemned for brevity before I
could put forth my defence. My plea is, I writ yours, as likewise one to
Harry Yardley, of equal importance, in the space of three hours. My
letter was really longer than yours by Scripture proof; for you writ scarce
much out of your abundance of thoughts; whereas I writ all that I thought
of, and thought of all I could write. I have not the presumption to compare
my expressions or style with yours, because there I am excelled beyond

“<span class="smcap">Robert Kirkham.</span>”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The above somewhat frothy epistle indicates an important
fact, that Wesley was in love with Miss Betty, Kirkham’s
sister, or, at all events, that Kirkham wished to have him for
a brother. Nothing more is known of this incipient courtship,
except that in a letter to Wesley, dated five days after Kirkham’s,
and written by Martha Wesley, it is said, “When I
knew that you were just returned from Worcestershire, where
I suppose you saw your <i>Varanese</i>, I then ceased to wonder at
your silence, for the sight of such a woman, ‘so known, so
loved,’ might well make you forget me. I really have myself
a vast respect for her, as I must necessarily have for one that
is so dear to you.” Wesley soon became far too much immersed
in more serious things to have time to think of wooing.
He writes:—</p>

<p>“Removing to another (Lincoln) college, I began to see
more and more the value of time. I applied myself closer to
study. I watched more carefully against actual sins. I advised
others to be religious, according to that scheme of religion
by which I modelled my own life. But meeting now
with Mr. Law’s ‘Christian Perfection’ and ‘Serious Call,’ although
I was much offended at many parts of both, yet they
convinced me more than ever of the exceeding height and
breadth and depth of the law of God. The light flowed in so
mightily upon my soul, that everything appeared in a new
view. I cried to God for help, resolved, as I had never done
before, not to prolong the time of obeying Him. And by my
continued endeavour to keep His whole law, inward and outward,
to the utmost of my power, I was persuaded that I
should be accepted of Him, and that I was even then in a
state of salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>William Law will have to be noticed hereafter. Suffice it
to remark now, that, after obtaining a fellowship at Emanuel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
College, Cambridge, and officiating as a curate in the metropolis,
he refused to take the oaths prescribed by parliament
on the accession of George I., lost his fellowship, left the
pulpit, and became tutor to Edward Gibbon, father of the
renowned historian. He was now resident at Putney, and is
described as rather above the middle size, stout but not corpulent,
with broad shoulders, grey eyes, round visage, well-proportioned
features, an open countenance, and rather inclined
to be merry than mournful. His “Christian Perfection”
was first published in 1726, just before Wesley read it; and, in
strong, clear, racy language, maintains that Christianity requires
a change of nature, a renunciation of the world and
worldly tempers, self-denial and mortification, in short, a life
perfectly devoted to the service of God. Clergymen are reminded
that it is far more important to visit the poor and
sick, and to be wholly occupied in the cure of souls, than in
studying the old grammarians. Vain books and stage entertainments
are denounced in the strongest terms; and a close
imitation of the life and example of Christ Jesus is enforced
with the utmost earnestness. The work throughout is one of
the most intensely religious books in the English language;
and had it shown the way of attaining holiness as clearly as it
enforces the practice of it, it would in all respects have been
unequalled. The “Serious Call” is a kindred book, and
written in the same earnest and pungent style. “It is,”
wrote Wesley, within eighteen months of his decease,—“It is
a treatise which will hardly be excelled, if it be equalled, in
the English tongue, either for beauty of expression, or for
justness and depth of thought.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The effect produced upon Wesley,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> by reading these two
invaluable books, was immense. “I was convinced,” says he
“more than ever of the impossibility of being half a Christian,
and determined to be all devoted to God, to give Him all my
soul, my body, and my substance.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Wesley’s intentions were as sincere and pure as grace could
make them; but his ideas of Christian truth were confused,
misty, erroneous. He was spending several hours every day
in reading the Scripture in the original tongues; and yet he
tells us that it was not until years after this that he became
convinced of the great truths, which, above all other truths,
gave rise to the societies of the people called Methodists.
These truths he himself has specified in the following terms:—“The
justification, whereof our articles and homilies speak,
means present forgiveness, pardon of sins, and consequently
acceptance with God. I believe the condition of this is faith;
I mean, not only that without faith we cannot be justified,
but also that, as soon as any one has true faith, in that moment
he is justified. Good works follow this faith, but cannot go
before it; much less can sanctification, which implies a continued
course of good works, springing from holiness of heart.</p>

<p>“Repentance must go before faith, and fruits meet for it, if
there be opportunity. By repentance, I mean conviction of
sin, producing real desires and sincere resolutions of amendment;
and by ‘fruits meet for repentance,’ I mean forgiving
our brother, ceasing from evil and doing good, using the
ordinances of God, and in general obeying Him according to
the measure of grace which we have received. But these I
cannot as yet term good works; because they do not spring
from faith and the love of God.</p>

<p>“By salvation I mean, not barely deliverance from hell, or
going to heaven, but a present deliverance from sin, a restoration
of the soul to its primitive health, its original purity;
a recovery of the Divine nature; the renewal of our souls
after the image of God, in righteousness and true holiness, in
justice, mercy, and truth. This implies all holy and heavenly
tempers, and by consequence, all holiness of conversation.</p>

<p>“Faith is the sole condition of this salvation. Without faith
we cannot thus be saved; for we cannot rightly serve God
unless we love Him. And we cannot love Him unless we
know Him; neither can we know Him unless by faith.</p>

<p>“Faith, in general, is a Divine, supernatural evidence, or
conviction of things not seen; that is, of things past, future,
or spiritual. Justifying faith implies, not only a Divine evidence,
or conviction, that God was in Christ, reconciling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
world unto Himself; but a sure trust and confidence that
Christ died for my sins; that He loved me and gave Himself
for me. And the moment a penitent sinner believes this, God
pardons and absolves him.</p>

<p>“And as soon as his pardon or justification is witnessed to
him by the Holy Ghost, he is saved. He loves God and all
mankind. He has the mind that was in Christ, and power to
walk as He also walked. From that time (unless he makes
shipwreck of the faith) salvation gradually increases in his
soul.</p>

<p>“The Author of faith and salvation is God alone. He is the
sole Giver of every good gift, and the sole Author of every
good work. There is no more of power than of merit in man;
but as all merit is in the Son of God, in what He has done
and suffered for us, so all power is in the Spirit of God. And
therefore every man, in order to believe unto salvation, must
receive the Holy Ghost. This is essentially necessary to
every Christian, in order to have faith, peace, joy, and love. Whoever
has these fruits of the Spirit cannot but know and feel
that God has wrought them in his heart.”</p>

<p>The reader has here, in Wesley’s own words, a summary of
all the doctrines which technically may be termed the doctrines
of the <i>first Methodists</i>. It was the preaching of these doctrines,
and of these only, that created Methodism in 1739.
And, to be faithful to the principles of their founder, the
Methodists of this, and of every age succeeding, <i>must</i>, <span class="allsmcap">MUST</span>
make these the <i>chief</i> doctrines of their ministry. Wesley
preached other truths besides these: but these were the truths
which distinguished him from his fellows; which gave birth to
the system that bears his name; and which he always made
<i>prominent</i> in his sermons and in his books, to the end of life.
Methodism will sink and deservedly become extinct, when it
ceases to proclaim, as its <i>greatest</i> dogmas, the above summary
of Methodistic doctrines, drawn up by Wesley himself
in 1744.</p>

<p>This summary is introduced here because, notwithstanding
his deep religious feeling, his pure intentions, and his strict
morality, the doctrines it embraces were doctrines of which
Wesley remained strangely ignorant for nearly thirteen years
after his ordination, in 1725. He writes: “It was many years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
after I was ordained deacon, before I was convinced of the
great truths above recited. During all that time, I was utterly
ignorant of the nature and condition of justification. Sometimes
I confounded it with sanctification (particularly when I
was in Georgia); at other times I had some confused notion
about the forgiveness of sins; but then I took it for granted
the time of this must be either the hour of death, or the day
of judgment. I was equally ignorant of the nature of saving
faith; apprehending it to mean no more than a ‘firm assent
to all the propositions contained in the Old and New Testaments.’”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Such, at this period, were Wesley’s views of Christian truth,
principally derived from his mother, from Thomas à Kempis,
Jeremy Taylor, and William Law. Some have charged him
with embracing the mystic divinity, but, except so far as the
mystic writers denied the doctrine of justification by faith, the
charge is unfounded. In reply to this accusation, Wesley
writes: “It is true that, for a while, I admired the <i>mystic
writers</i>. But I dropped them, even before I went to Georgia;
long before I knew or suspected anything as to justification by
faith. Therefore all that follows of my ‘making my system
of divinity more commodious for general use,’ having no
foundation, falls to the ground at once. I never was ‘in the
way of mysticism’ at all.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Wesley took his degree of Master of Arts, on February 14,
1727. In his disputation for this he acquired considerable reputation;
delivering three lectures on the occasion, one “De
Anima Brutorum;” a second, “De Julio Cæsare;” and a
third, “De Amore Dei.” These early orations seem to be
entirely lost.</p>

<p>Another step taken by Wesley, about the same period, was
to rid himself of unprofitable friends. He writes: “When it
pleased God to give me a settled resolution to be not a
<i>nominal</i>, but a <i>real</i> Christian (being then about twenty-two
years of age), my acquaintance were as ignorant of God as
myself. But there was this difference: I knew my own ignorance;
they did not know theirs. I faintly endeavoured to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
help them, but in vain. Meantime, I found, by sad experience,
that even their <i>harmless</i> conversation, so called, damped
all my good resolutions. I saw no possible way of getting rid
of them, unless it should please God to remove me to another
college. He did so, in a manner utterly contrary to all human
probability. I was elected fellow of a college where I knew
not one person. I foresaw abundance of people would come
to see me, either out of friendship, civility, or curiosity; and
that I should have offers of acquaintance new and old: but I
had now fixed my plan. I resolved to have no acquaintance
by chance, but by choice; and to choose such only as would
help me on my way to heaven. In consequence of this, I
narrowly observed the temper and behaviour of all that visited
me. I saw no reason to think that the greater part of these
truly loved or feared God: therefore, when any of them came
to see me, I behaved as courteously as I could; but to the
question, ‘When will you come to see me?’ I returned no
answer. When they had come a few times, and found I still
declined returning the visit, I saw them no more. And, I
bless God, this has been my invariable rule for about three-score
years. I knew many reflections would follow; but that
did not move me, as I knew full well it was my calling to go
through evil report and good report.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Wesley free himself from trifling companions.
About the same time, some one proposed to him a well
endowed school in Yorkshire, and suggested, as an inducement
for him to accept it, that it was situated “in a little vale,
so pent up between two hills” that it was scarcely accessible;
a place where he could “expect little company from without,
and within none at all.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This school was either never
offered, or, if it was, the offer was declined.</p>

<p>Wesley now laid down a plan of study, and closely followed
it. Mondays and Tuesdays he devoted to the Greek and
Roman classics, historians and poets; Wednesdays, to logic
and ethics; Thursdays to Hebrew and Arabic; Fridays to
metaphysics and natural philosophy; Saturdays to oratory
and poetry, chiefly composing; and Sundays, to divinity.
In intermediate hours, he perfected himself in the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
language, which he had begun to learn two or three years before;
sometimes amused himself with experiments in optics;
and in mathematics studied Euclid, Keil, and Sir Isaac
Newton. First, he read an author regularly through, and then
transcribed into a commonplace book such passages as he
thought important or beautiful. In this way he greatly increased
his stock of knowledge and inured himself to hard working.</p>

<p>His father was now sixty-five years of age, and was already
palsied; his mother also was in exceedingly ill health; and
hence, in August, 1727, he removed to Lincolnshire, for the
purpose of officiating as his father’s curate at Epworth and
at Wroote; and here, with the exception of about three
months, he remained until November, 1729.</p>

<p>The details of this period of two years and a quarter in
Wesley’s history are few. His life at Epworth and Wroote
was doubtless the ordinary every-day sort of life of an earnest
country parish clergyman. Fortunately, one of his sermons,
preached during the time that he was his father’s curate, has
been preserved, and is important as showing how, from the
very commencement of his ministry, he rigidly adhered to the
principle of preaching the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. The text is 2 Corinthians ii. 17, and the subject
of the sermon is that of “corrupting the word of God.” Among
corrupters he notices:—1. Those who introduce “into it
human mixtures, and blend with the oracles of God impure
dreams, fit only for the mouth of the devil.” 2. Those who
mix it “with false interpretations.” 3. Those who do not add
to it but take from it, “washing their hands of stubborn texts,
that will not bend to their purposes, or that too plainly touch
upon the reigning vices of the places where they live.” Those
who do not corrupt the word of God “preach it genuine and
unmixed,” unimpaired and in all its fulness. “They speak
with plainness and boldness, and are not concerned to palliate
their doctrine to reconcile it to the tastes of men. They will
not, they dare not, soften a threatening so as to prejudice its
strength; neither represent sin in such mild colours as to
impair its native blackness.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Here we have Wesley, in the twenty-fifth year of his age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
displaying the same conscientious fidelity and unflinching
boldness, which so strikingly characterized the whole of his
future ministry.</p>

<p>In July, 1728, Wesley repaired to Oxford, where, on Sunday,
September 22, he was ordained priest by Dr. Potter,
who had ordained him deacon in 1725. Nine days afterwards,
he returned to his curacy at Wroote, where, as already
stated, he continued preaching and fulfilling other ministerial
duties until November 22, 1729.</p>

<p>What were the results of Wesley’s preaching? Wesley
himself shall tell us. He writes: “I preached much, but saw
no fruit of my labour. Indeed, it could not be that I should;
for I neither laid the foundation of repentance, nor of believing
the gospel; taking it for granted that all to whom I
preached were believers, and that many of them needed no
repentance.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Let Christian ministers be admonished. Is it
not a fact—a general, if not universal fact—that where these
doctrines are not preached all other preaching is almost, if
not altogether, useless? Christ’s ministry throughout was in
perfect accordance with its commencement, when following
John the Baptist, as His high herald, He cried, “Repent ye,
and believe the gospel.” This kind of preaching is always
useful. Would to God we had more of it at the present
day!</p>

<p>Wroote was a wretched place. Wesley says it was “surrounded
with bogs;”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and, according to Samuel, his brother,
the parsonage was roofed with thatch and made lively by the
mingled music of “kittens and whelps,” “pigs and porkets,”
“bellowing kine and bleating lambs, quacking ducks and
fluttering hens.” Describing his father’s presence there, he
writes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>
<p>The church was a small brick building, and the population,
even as late as 1821, was under three hundred. The people
were, says Mehetabel Wesley, “unpolished wights,” as “dull
as asses,” and with heads “as impervious as stones.”</p>

<p>Such were Wesley’s parish and parishioners—not exactly
the place where a poetical genius and classic scholar was likely
to luxuriate; and yet there is no reason to entertain a doubt
that Wesley was happy in his new sphere of labour. He loved
retirement, and here he had it. It is not improbable that, for
many a long year, Wroote would have been his residence, had
not the rector of Lincoln College wished to have him back to
Oxford. This gentleman had rendered such service to the
Wesley family that the venerable father used to say, “I can
refuse him nothing.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Accordingly, the following letter, by
Dr. Morley, was irresistible.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>October 21, 1729.</i>
</p>

<p>“At a meeting of the society, just before I left college, to consider the
proper method to preserve discipline and good government, it was, in the
opinion of all present, judged necessary that the junior fellows, who
should be chosen moderators, shall in person attend the duties of their
office, if they do not prevail with some of the fellows to officiate for them.
We all thought it would be a great hardship on Mr. Fenton to call him
from a perpetual curacy; yet this we must have done, had not Mr.
Hutchins been so kind to him and us as to engage to supply his place
in the hall for the present year. Mr. Robinson would as willingly supply
yours, but the serving of two cures, about fourteen miles from Oxford,
makes it, he says, impossible to discharge the duty constantly. We hope
it may be as much for your advantage to reside at college as where you
are, if you take pupils, or can get a curacy in the neighbourhood of Oxon.
Your father may certainly have another curate, though not so much to
his satisfaction; yet we are persuaded that this will not move him to
hinder your return to college, since the interests of the college and obligation
to statute require it.”</p>
</div>

<p>And so, because Fenton had a perpetual curacy, too good
to be given up; and because Robinson, in his two parishes, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
as much work as he could do, Wesley was forcibly removed
from Wroote, and brought back to Oxford to fulfil his functions
as a fellow. No time was lost. He returned to Oxford on
November 22, 1729, and here continued until he embarked
for Georgia on the 14th of October, 1735.</p>

<small><i>OXFORD METHODISM, ETC.</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1729

Age 26</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WESLEY returned to Oxford shortly after the coronation
of George II. In some respects this was an age
of giants. Bolingbroke, though a rake and an infidel, was
a man of exalted powers and of splendid eloquence. Walpole,
more than any other man, was the means of keeping the
British crown on the heads of the house of Hanover. The
Earl of Granville, by his brilliant talents, raised himself to the
highest offices of state; though, thinking ignorance the best
security for obedience, he opposed the education of the
poor, and disliked the propagation of Christ’s religion in
the colonies. Chesterfield was a gambler and a <i>roué</i>, but,
as Johnson said, “he was also a wit among lords, and a lord
among wits.”</p>

<p>In the Church, Atterbury, though a Jacobite, passionate,
ambitious, and double dealing, was also talented, learned,
and eloquent. Whiston, though extremely heterodox, was a
man of great ability. Gibson, Bishop of London, was one
whose piety was equal to his erudition. Hoadly, Bishop
of Winchester, has, not without reason, been pronounced
“the greatest dissenter that ever wore a mitre.” Sherlock
was famous for his pulpit power. The head of Waterland
was “an immense library, where the treasures of learning were
arranged in such exact order that whatever he or his friends
wanted he could produce at once.” To these might be added
Butler, Secker, Warburton, and others.</p>

<p>Among the Dissenters we find Edmund Calamy, Isaac
Watts, Nathaniel Lardner, and Philip Doddridge.</p>

<p>Among men of science and of letters, Edmund Halley was
exploring the starry heavens; and Sir Hans Sloane was
revelling among the plants and flowers of earth. Nicholas
Saunderson, blind from childhood, was lecturing upon optics;
Roubiliac was making marble almost breathe, and Handel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
composing his immortal oratorios. Tindal was pouring out his
streams of erudite infidelity. Daniel De Foe was still living.
Bentley was at the zenith of his literary fame. Jonathan
Swift was playing the part of a clever ecclesiastical buffoon.
Edward Young was pondering poetry among the tombs of
his own churchyard. Pope was employing his accomplished
genius, surrounded by the beauties of his lovely retreat at
Twickenham. Gay was composing comedies with more ability
than ambition. Richardson, afterwards the novelist, was
writing “indexes, prefaces, and honest dedications.” Savage
was penning beautiful ideas amid tavern riots and cellar filth.
Thomson, so lazy as to be a fit occupant for his own “Castle
of Indolence,” was suffering his eye to roll in a fine frenzy
among the beauties of the “Seasons;” and Samuel Johnson
was preparing himself to be the Jupiter of letters, and to rule
the literary world.</p>

<p>Greatness unfortunately does not always give birth to
goodness. “Never,” says a modern writer,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> “has century
risen on Christian England so void of soul and faith as that
which opened with Queen Anne, and which reached its misty
noon beneath the second George—a dewless night succeeded
by a sunless dawn. There was no freshness in the past,
and no promise in the future. The Puritans were buried, and
the Methodists were not born. The philosopher of the age
was Bolingbroke, the moralist was Addison, the minstrel
was Pope, and the preacher was Atterbury. The world had
the idle, discontented look of the morning after some mad
holiday, and, like rocket-sticks and the singed paper from last
night’s squibs, the spent jokes of Charles and Rochester lay
all about, and people yawned to look at them. The reign of
buffoonery was past, but the reign of faith and earnestness
had not commenced.”</p>

<p>Let it not be said that this is modern imagination. Bishops
are, or ought to be, sober minded men, and to one of these we
refer the reader for a testimony concerning the moral and
religious state of England during the period of which we are
now writing. The Bishop of Lichfield, in 1724, in a sermon
before the Society for the Reformation of Manners, said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“The Lord’s day is now the devil’s market day. More
lewdness, more drunkenness, more quarrels and murders, more
sin is contrived and committed on this day than on all the
other days of the week together. Strong liquors are become
the epidemic distemper of this great city. More of the common
people die of consumptions, fevers, dropsies, cholics,
palsies, and apoplexies, contracted by the immoderate use of
brandies and distilled waters, than of all other distempers
besides, arising from other causes. Sin, in general, is grown
so hardened and rampant, as that immoralities are defended,
yea, justified on principle. Obscene, wanton, and profane books
find so good a market as to encourage the trade of publishing
them. Every kind of sin has found a writer to teach and
vindicate it, and a bookseller and hawker to divulge and
spread it.”</p>

<p>These were not rash and random statements. From the
report of the society before which the bishop preached, it
appears that in that very year, 1724, the society had prosecuted
not fewer than 2723 persons for lewd, profane, drunken,
and gambling practices; and that during the last thirty-three
years the number of their prosecutions had been 89,393.</p>

<p>From the literature of the period, we learn that gin-drinking
in the great towns of England had become a mania; the
sellers of this pernicious spirit announcing on their signboards
that they would make a man drunk for a penny, and find him
straw on which to lie till he recovered the use of his lost
faculties. In 1736 every sixth house in London was a licensed
grogshop, and parliament, to check the evil, enacted that all
intoxicating spirits should pay a duty of £1 per gallon, and
every victualler £50 per annum for his licence.</p>

<p>In the higher classes of society, the taint left by Charles
II and his licentious court still festered. Among the
lower classes, laziness and dishonesty were next to universal.
Superstition flourished almost as vigorously as it had done in
the middle ages, and nearly every old mansion in England
was haunted by a ghost, and almost every parish tormented
by a witch. In the metropolis, Ranelagh and Vauxhall were
the resorts of thousands, of the upper strata of society; and
puppetshows, hops, balls, prize-fights, merry meetings, cockfights,
and badger-baitings furnished entertainment for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
masses. In the rural districts, rustic squires found their
greatest enjoyment in hunting foxes, and in gorging venison,
and guzzling sack; while the peasantry relieved the monotony
of their daily toils at wakes and fairs, and in wrestling, cudgel
playing, and foot racing.</p>

<p>Extravagance was the order of the day. Scarcely one
family in ten kept within its income. The grand controversy
then, as now, was, who should <i>out-dress</i>, <i>out-drink</i>, or <i>out-eat</i>
his neighbour. Citizens and young tradesmen, whose ancestors
would have fainted at the sight of drawing-rooms, were the
chief visitors at plays and masquerades; and even shopkeepers
were seen wearing long wigs and swords, velvet breeches
and hunting caps. Families, who were oftentimes resolved
into committees on ways and means to pay a butcher’s bill,
paraded themselves in attire the most pompous, and adorned
with the richest brocades and jewels. London swarmed with
ruined rakes and broken traders, who contrived to live in the
best society by reciting scraps of poetry, singing licentious
songs, and retailing drunken puns and quibbles. In fact,
all ranks and classes seemed to be corrupted to the core. “A
sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers;
children that are corrupters; the whole head is sick, and the
whole heart faint; from the sole of the foot even unto the
head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds, bruises, and
putrifying sores.”</p>

<p>What was done to improve this state of things? From
a report of the charity schools, we learn that, in 1715,
there were, throughout the kingdom, 1193 schools for the
education of the children of the poor, containing 26,920
scholars. In other words, and to say nothing of other
churches, there are at present in the Wesleyan-Methodist
day-schools of England four times more scholars than there
were in all the schools for primary education throughout
the kingdom in 1715.</p>

<p>Turning from schools to churches, there is no amelioration
of the dark picture. The Church, which ought to have
reformed the nation, needed to be reformed itself. The
Dissenters complained of their ministers conforming to the
Establishment, but comforted themselves with thinking that
the apostates were mainly young fops and dandies. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
three Dissenting denominations, Presbyterians, Independents,
and Baptists, considered themselves the great barriers to the
doctrine of passive obedience to the crown, and of submission
to the priestly encroachments of the Church. They maintained
that they had greatly contributed to the interests of the
Protestant succession, and had promoted a better observance
of the sabbath, and the more frequent preaching of the high
church clergy; but still they lamented that numbers of their
ministers were immoral, negligent, and insufficient; that they
devoted too much time to the fashionable study of the
classics, and read their sermons instead of preaching them.
They also complained of their children being sent to high
church schools, and of the artful caballing of their congregations
in appointing ministers to vacant pastorates. (See
“Observations upon the Present State of the Dissenting
Interest.” London: 1731.)</p>

<p>The clergy of the Established Church! What of them?
Bishop Burnet, in 1713, wrote: “Our ember weeks are the
burden and grief of my life. The much greater part of those who
come to be ordained are ignorant to a degree not to be apprehended
by those who are not obliged to know it. The easiest
part of knowledge is that to which they are the greatest
strangers; I mean the plainest parts of the Scriptures. They
can give no account, or at least a very imperfect one, of the
contents even of the gospels, or of the catechism itself.”</p>

<p>This is a doleful picture, but there was more than this. The
dissensions in the Church of England then were quite as
violent as dissensions now. The high church clergy were
moral, and many of them talented and learned, but they
were as intolerant as intolerance could make them. Of course,
they held that none were ministers of Christ except those
who had been <i>episcopally</i> ordained; and hence they held that
all sacraments administered by Dissenters were invalid, and all
Dissenting churches in a state of sin and damnation. They
boldly preached the doctrine of a proper sacrifice being made
in the Christian eucharist, and most furiously contended for
the Divine right of kings, and the kindred dogma of passive
obedience. Many of them, in heart at least, were Jacobites,
and, while promising allegiance, regarded King George as
a usurper, and branded those of their brethren who differed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
from them with opprobrium. Endless were the pamphlets
published, and fierce were the feuds of those who ought to
have dwelt together in unity. The foulest sins were made
sinless by intemperate zeal for the Pretender, and the fairest
virtues were besmeared in those who showed a friendly
feeling for Dissenters. A man might be drunken and quarrelsome
all the week, but if on Sunday he bowed to the altar
and cursed King William he was esteemed a saint. He might
cheat everybody, and pay nobody, but if he drank health
to the royal orphan, hated King George, and abhorred the
Whigs, his want of probity was a peccadillo scarce worth
noticing. On the other hand, a man might be learned, diligent,
devout, and useful, but if he opposed the Pretender and
Popery, or if he thought the Dissenters should not be damned,
he was at once set down as heterodox, and, according to his
importance, became a target for the poisoned shafts of high
church malice.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the state of things when God raised up
the Methodists. The court of England was corrupt to its
very core, and the people were too faithful imitators of a bad
example. Popery was intriguing, Dissenters were declining,
and the Church was full of fiery and drunken feuds. Reformers,
like the Methodists, were needed. Without them, or
others of a kindred spirit, the nation must have sunk into an
inconceivable depth of depravity, and social and political
degradation. In estimating the benefits which have accrued
from the great Methodist movement, the reader must think
not only of the good effected but of the ill averted.</p>

<p>Methodism arose in Oxford, and not before it was needed,
even there. When Wesley returned to the university in 1729,
the vice-chancellor, the heads of houses and proctors,
issued an edict, which was posted in most of the college
halls, to the effect that certain members of the university had
of late been in danger of being corrupted by the wicked and
blasphemous notions of the advocates of pretended human
reason against Divine revelation; and that therefore it was a
matter of the utmost consequence that the college tutors
should use double diligence in explaining to their respective
pupils the articles of religion and their Christian duty, and in
recommending to them the frequent and careful reading of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the Scriptures, and such other books as might serve more
effectually the orthodox faith and sound principles.</p>

<p>The Dean of Christ Church, however, where Charles
Wesley was a tutor, was so much a friend to infidelity, that he
forbade the posting of this edict in his college hall, forgetting
that there was One higher than himself, who, in that very
college, had already begun to raise one of the strongest
barriers against the spread of this pernicious evil.</p>

<p>A few months afterwards, on the 4th of July, 1730, it was
announced in <i>Fogg’s Weekly Journal</i>, that one of the principal
colleges in Oxford had of late been infested with Deists, and
that three Deistical students had been expelled, and a fourth
had had his degree deferred two years, during which he was to
be closely confined in college, and, among other things, was to
translate Leslie’s “Short and Easy Method with the Deists.”</p>

<p>Wesley was now a tutor in Lincoln College, and presided
in the hall as Moderator in the disputations, six of which were
held weekly; and, by this, he acquired the remarkable expertness
in arguing, and in discerning and pointing out well
concealed and plausible fallacies, which distinguished him to
the end of life. He writes: “In November, 1729, the then
Rector of Lincoln College, Dr. Morley, sent for me to Oxford,
to take pupils, eleven of whom he put under my care immediately.
In this employ I continued<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> till 1735, when I
went as a <i>missioner</i> to Georgia.” Several of Wesley’s pupils
were among the first Oxford Methodists.</p>

<p>The Methodist movement, however, was begun not by
Wesley, but by his brother Charles. When the latter was
elected to Christ Church, in 1726, he was a sprightly, rollicking
young fellow, with more genius than grace; John spoke
to him about religion, but Charles answered, “What, would
you have me to be a saint all at once!” This was an unfavourable
beginning; but, while John was serving as his
father’s curate at Epworth and at Wroote, Charles began
to attend the weekly sacrament, and induced two or three
other students to attend with him. On John’s return from
Lincolnshire, he heartily united with his brother and his friends.
The regularity of their behaviour led a young collegian to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
call them Methodists; and “as the name,” says Wesley,
“was new and quaint, it clave to them immediately, and, from
that time, all that had any connection with them were thus
distinguished.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The name was not new. Wesley says “it was given in
allusion to an ancient sect of physicians, of the time of the
Emperor Nero, who taught that almost all diseases might
be cured by a specific <i>method</i> of diet and exercise.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This
might be so, and yet it is a curious fact that the name was
in use in England long before it was applied to Wesley and
his friends. In 1693 a pamphlet was published with the title,
“A War among the Angels of the Churches: wherein is
shewed the Principles of the New Methodists in the great point
of Justification. By a Country Professor of Jesus Christ.” And
even as early as 1639, in a sermon preached at Lambeth the
following perfumed eloquence occurs:—“Where are now our
Anabaptists, and plain pack-staff Methodists, who esteem all
flowers of rhetoric in sermons no better than stinking weeds,
and all elegance of speech no better than profane spells?”</p>

<p>The two young gentlemen who, with Wesley and his brother
Charles, were first called Methodists, were Robert Kirkham,
already mentioned on a previous page, and William
Morgan.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> To these were subsequently added, George Whitefield,
John Clayton, J. Broughton, Benjamin Ingham, James
Hervey, John Whitelamb, Westley Hall, John Gambold,
Charles Kinchin, William Smith, and Messrs. Salmon, Wogan,
Boyce, Atkinson, and others.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>What shall we say of these Oxford Methodists?</p>

<p>William Morgan’s career was brief and painful; he was
the first Methodist who passed the pearly gates of the celestial
city. Charles Kinchin, a lovely character, soon followed him.
Charles Wesley, in his incomparable hymns, left behind him
one of the noblest legacies that an uninspired man ever bequeathed
to the Christian church. George Whitefield was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
prince of preachers—a glorious emblem of the apocalyptic
angel flying through the midst of heaven with the good
tidings of great joy unto all people. And James Hervey will
be loved and honoured as long as there are men to appreciate
the highest order of Christian piety and the most
mellifluent compositions in the English language.</p>

<p>The history of the Oxford Methodists is not, however, an
unspotted one. Clayton’s high churchism was not an excellency
to be admired. Broughton’s usefulness was crippled and cut
short by his imperfect, stunted, stereotyped views of Christian
truth. Westley Hall, though we hope he died a penitent, was,
throughout the greatest part of his vicious life, an unmitigated
scamp. John Whitelamb sunk down into an ecclesiastical
village drone. Gambold, though good, was visionary, and
throughout life was injured by his Moravian maggots. And
Ingham, for many years one of the most successful of evangelists,
through the ill judged connections that he formed, died
beneath a cloud. But, with all these drawbacks, the reader is
challenged to produce a band of godly friends, whose lives and
labours have, upon the whole, issued in such an amount of
blessing to mankind as that which has resulted from the lives
and labours of the students who, in 1735, were known as
“Oxford Methodists.” They were widely scattered; their
views were different; they were often brought into painful
collision with each other; but, with the one or two exceptions
mentioned, they were all sincere, earnest, laborious, successful
ministers of Christ; and five or six of them must for ever occupy
a high position in the history of the Christian church. Clayton
shunned the Wesleys; Broughton opposed them; Ingham left
them; Hervey, though with Christian courtesy, wrote against
them; Gambold, at one period, hesitated not to say that he was
ashamed of them; and even Whitefield, for a little while, was
alienated from them; but we earnestly hope and have little
doubt that they have all long been re-united in that blessed
world where friends are free from misconceptions, and where
the din of controversial strife does not exist—a world where
all churches are merged into one grand Church, the members
of which make one vast, happy, and harmonious family, and
sing in the same ceaseless tune the same great song for ever—the
song of Moses and of the Lamb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Of the Methodists, three were tutors in colleges; and the
rest were bachelors of arts, or undergraduates. All were of
one judgment and of one heart; and all tenacious of order to
the last degree, and observant, for conscience sake, of every rule
of the Church, and every statute both of the university and of
their respective colleges. They all thought themselves orthodox
in every point, firmly believing, not only the three creeds,
but whatsoever they judged to be the doctrine of the Church
of England, as contained in her articles and homilies. Practically,
they had all things common; and no one was allowed
to want what another had the ability to spare.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Wesley was
nicknamed “the Curator of the Holy Club,” and not a few
branded him a “crack-brained enthusiast”; and yet others acknowledged
that though his views and doctrines were peculiar
his piety was unimpeachable; and Mr. Gerard, the bishop’s
chaplain, dared to express an opinion to George Lascelles,
one of his revilers, that he “would one day be a standard-bearer
of the Cross, either in his own country or beyond
the seas.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Charles Wesley paid the utmost deference to his
brother, and all the Methodists acknowledged his fitness to be
their chief director. This was not surprising, for, confessedly,
he had more learning and experience than the others; and
was blessed with such activity and steadiness that he was
always gaining ground, and losing none. Every affair was
well considered before he propounded it, and all his decisions
were made in the fear of God, without passion, or self-confidence.
His countenance also wore an air of authority; and
yet there was no assumption of super-eminence; but all were
allowed to speak their minds with the utmost freedom, and no
one was a more respectful listener than himself. Hence it was,
that, whatever proposals he submitted, they were readily
adopted, and the brotherhood was as perfect as unity of sentiment
and feeling could make it.</p>

<p>Every night they met together,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> to review what each had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
done during the day, and to consult what should be done the
day following; their meetings always commencing with prayer,
and ending with a frugal supper. Their plans of action were
various. Some conversed with young students, and endeavoured
to rescue them from evil company, and to encourage
them in a sober and studious life. Others undertook the instruction
and relief of impoverished families; others the charge
of some particular school, and others of the parish workhouse.
Some or other of them went daily to the Castle, and to the
city prison, reading in the chapel, to as many of the prisoners
as would attend, books like the “Christian Monitor” and the
“Country Parson’s Advice to his Parishioners,” and then
summing up the reading in a few sentences easy to be remembered.
On the introduction of a new prisoner, they
would subject him to the most searching examination as to
whether he bore malice towards his prosecutors or others, and
whether he repented of his sins, and used private prayer, and
received the sacrament. Out of their own scanty means, and
by quarterly contributions from others, they raised a fund to
purchase books, medicines, and other necessaries for the
prisoners, and to release those who were confined for debts of
small amount. They read prayers at the Castle on most
Wednesdays and Fridays, preached a sermon to the prisoners
every Sunday, and administered the sacrament once a
month. One of the schools which they visited was a school
which Wesley himself had founded, the mistress of which
he paid, and some, if not all, of the children of which he
clothed.</p>

<p>In all this the world saw nought but oddity and folly, and
called these hardworking and godly students “Bible bigots,”
and “Bible moths;” but, in the midst of all, Wesley calmly
pursued the path which he had marked out for himself and
his friends. Gambold, in a letter written whilst Wesley was
in Georgia, tells us that Wesley at Oxford was always cheerful
but never arrogant. By strict watchfulness, he beat down
the impetuosity of his nature into a childlike simplicity.
His piety was nourished by continual communion with God,
for he thought prayer to be his greatest duty; and often did
Gambold see him come out of his closet of devotion with a
serenity of countenance that was next to shining. The secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
consolations of God seldom left him, and never but in a
posture of strong and longsuffering faith. In him there were
no idle cravings, no chagrin or sickliness of spirit. Slanders
never ruffled him, and his chief fear was lest he should grow
proud of this conformity to his great Master. Coming home
from long journeys, where he had been in different companies,
he would calmly resume his usual employments, as
if he had never left them. Himself setting an example,
he urged upon his associates method, diligence, and early
rising. His hours for private devotion were from five to six
o’clock every morning and every night. Every day he noted
in a diary what had been his chief employments; and
one day every week he set apart for writing letters to his
friends.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>His charity to the poor was limited only by the means at
his command. One cold winter’s day, he tells us, a young
girl, whom the Methodists kept at school, called upon him in a
state nearly frozen, to whom he said, “You seem half-starved;
have you nothing to wear but that linen gown?” The poor
girl said, “Sir, this is all I have.” Wesley put his hand in his
pocket, but found it nearly empty. The walls of his chamber
however were hung with pictures, and these now became his
accusers. “It struck me,” says he, “will thy Master say,
‘Well done, good and faithful steward’? thou hast adorned
thy walls with the money which might have screened this poor
creature from the cold! O Justice! O Mercy! Are not these
pictures the blood of this poor maid?”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> To say the least,
this story shows the intense conscientiousness of the man, and
his dread of spending anything upon himself which might
have been spent more properly upon the poor. He says
it was the practice of all the Oxford Methodists to give
away each year all they had after providing for their own
necessities; and then, as an illustration, he adds, in reference
to himself, “One of them had thirty pounds a year. He lived
on twenty-eight, and gave away forty shillings. The next
year receiving sixty pounds, he still lived on twenty-eight,
and gave away thirty-two. The third year he received ninety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
pounds, and gave away sixty-two. The fourth year he received
a hundred and twenty pounds; still he lived as before on
twenty-eight, and gave to the poor all the rest.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Wesley at Oxford was as conscientious in the use of time
as he was in the use of money. Finding that he awoke every
night about twelve or one o’clock, he concluded that this
arose from his lying longer in bed than nature needed; and,
to satisfy himself, he procured an alarum which aroused him
next morning at seven, an hour earlier than he rose the day
previous; but still he lay awake again at night. The second
morning his alarum roused him up at six; and the third at
five; but notwithstanding this he still lay awake when he
ought to have been fast asleep. The fourth morning, by
means of his alarum, he got up at four, and now wakefulness
was unknown to him. Sixty years after adopting this expedient
to ascertain how much sleep his nature needed, he
wrote, “By the grace of God, I have risen at four o’clock ever
since; and, taking the year round, I don’t lie awake a quarter
of an hour together in a month.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Bible now, as ever afterwards, was Wesley’s book of
books. He writes: “In 1729, I began not only to read, but
to study, the Bible, as the one, the only standard of truth, and
the only model of pure religion. Hence, I saw, in a clearer
and clearer light, the indispensable necessity of having ‘the
mind which was in Christ,’ and of ‘walking as Christ also
walked.’ I considered religion as an entire inward and outward
conformity to our Master. Nor was I afraid of anything
more than of bending this rule to the experience of myself,
or of other men; or of allowing myself in any the least disconformity
to our grand Exemplar.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Such was Wesley in 1729. What about his friends? To
some extent, their principles and practice may be learnt from
the scheme of self-examination they adopted. They tried to
act upon the principle of doing nothing without a previous
perception that it was the will of God. Every morning and
every evening they spent an hour in private prayer. They
always prayed in going in and out of church. Three days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
every week, though separate from each other, they, at the same
hour, prayed in concert. In secret devotion they frequently
stopped short to observe if they were using proper fervour,
and, before concluding in the name of Christ, they adverted
to the Saviour now interceding on their behalf at the right
hand of God, and offering up their prayers. They habituated
themselves to the use of ejaculations for humility, faith, hope,
and love; used a collect every day at nine, twelve, and three
o’clock; and each one said aloud, in his own room, a grace
before and after eating. They embraced every possible opportunity
of doing good, and of preventing, removing, or
lessening evil. They tried to spend an hour every day in
speaking to men directly on religious things, never relinquishing
the objects of their attention till they were positively repelled,
and always, before addressing them, trying to learn, as
far as possible, their tempers, way of life, and peculiar hindrances.
In order to converse usefully, they planned every
conversation before they went into company; and considered
what subject would be most useful, and how to prosecute
it.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> They persuaded all they could to attend public
prayers, sermons, and sacraments; and, in general, to obey the
laws of the church catholic, the Church of England, the state,
the university, and their respective colleges. They refrained
from thinking or speaking unkindly of any one; and used intercession
for their friends on Sundays, for their pupils on
Mondays, for those who particularly desired it on Wednesdays
and Fridays, and for the family with whom they lodged
every day.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> They also communicated at Christ Church once
a week.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>They had one, and only one, rule of judgment, with regard
to all their tempers, words, and actions—namely, the oracles of
God, and were one and all determined to be Bible Christians.
The book which, next to the holy Scripture, was of the greatest
use to them, in settling their judgment as to the grand point
of justification by faith, was the Book of Homilies.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>They were tenacious, not only of all the doctrines of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Church of England, but of all her discipline, to the minutest
points, and were scrupulously strict in observing the rubrics
and canons. In short, “they were,” says Wesley, “in the
strongest sense, high churchmen.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Many of their proceedings were ecclesiastically irregular,
though religiously right; and Wesley, fearful of doing evil
even while doing good, wrote to his brother Samuel and to
his father for advice. Samuel replied that, though there
might be some things concerning which he was dubious, yet
he would choose to follow his two brothers to the grave
rather than they should abandon their course of piety, and
especially that relating to the prisoners in the Castle.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The
venerable rector, in his reply, said, “As to your designs and
employments, what can I say less than <i>Valde probo</i>; and that
I have the highest reason to bless God that He has given me
two sons together at Oxford, to whom He has granted grace
and courage to turn the war against the world and the devil?”
At the same time, however, he advised them to obtain consent
to visit the prisoners from the chaplain, who had charge of
them, and likewise to seek the approbation of their bishop.
This advice was adopted; the chaplain commended their
design; and the bishop expressed himself as highly pleased
with their undertaking.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of the year 1730, Wesley had the
offer of a curacy, eight miles from Oxford, for three or for
six months, at the rate of £30 a year; and this he readily
accepted, not only because it opened to him a field of usefulness,
but also because it enabled him to retain his horse, when
he began to feel that he must sell it; for if he had not a horse
of his own he must hire one to ride to his cure on Sundays,
and the <i>hire</i> would be quite as expensive as the <i>keep</i>.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>It was in the same year that he begun his remarkable
correspondence with Mary Granville, afterwards the celebrated
wife and widow of the Very Rev. Dr. Delany,
Dean of Down, in Ireland. Mary Granville, while living
in Gloucestershire, became acquainted with Sarah, daughter
of the Rev. Lionel Kirkham, of Staunton; and, ever after,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the two ladies were the most devoted friends.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> We have
already seen that Wesley was a visitor of the Kirkhams;
and that, in 1726, a warm-hearted intimacy existed between
him and one of the young ladies of that family, whose pet
name, among her friends, was “Varanese.” It is almost
certain that it was here Wesley was first introduced to
the remarkable woman above-mentioned. Their correspondence
with each other was conducted in feigned names, Wesley
calling himself “Cyrus,” and Mary Granville calling herself
“Aspasia,” that being the name by which she was often
designated by her most intimate acquaintance.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The first
letter from “Aspasia” is dated “August 28th, 1730.” She
writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I think myself extremely obliged to you for the favour of the
sermon and the letters. I received them safe last week, and should
sooner have made my acknowledgments for them, but that I have been
engaged with so much company since my return from dear, delightful
Staunton, that, till this moment, I have not had time to express my
gratitude for the elegant entertainment I have had, not only from the manuscripts,
but in recollecting and repeating the conversation you and your
brother made so agreeable, which I hope will soon be renewed. If you
have any affairs that call you to Gloucester, don’t forget that you have
two pupils, who are desirous of improving their understanding; and that
friendship has already taught them to be, sir, your most sincere, humble
servants. My companion joins me in all I have said, as well as in service
to Araspes.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The companion referred to was probably Mary Granville’s
mother (with whom also Wesley corresponded),<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> or her beloved
friend, Sarah Kirkham. Araspes was most likely a
feigned name for Wesley’s brother Charles. On the fly-leaf
of the letter there is a postscript, in the handwriting of Mary
Granville’s sister, whose pet name was Selina, telling Wesley
that Aspasia was about to visit Bath, and that, if he designed
to wait upon her, he had best write to her to ascertain her
movements. He is further told that “Varanese” (see Robert
Kirkham’s letter, p. 50) had sent him a letter by the carrier
about a fortnight ago, and wished to know whether it had
come safe to hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Mary Granville, at this period, was the widow of Alexander
Pendarves, Esq., and was three years older than Wesley. As
a member of the Lansdowne family, she had moved in the
most fashionable circles of London society, and was now
a frequent attendant at ridottos, masquerades, operas, and
other amusements: but, in the midst of all, she maintained
an unblemished character; evinced talents and virtues of an
exceedingly high order; was received at court during each
successive reign; and, to the day of her death, was honoured
with the notice and confidence of George III. and his Queen
Charlotte. Are we justified in inferring, from the language
employed in the postscript of the above letter, that Wesley
was thinking of making Mary Granville (or rather Mrs. Pendarves)
his wife? Or that there was some intrigue among
his friends, to bring about an interview at Bath, and to initiate
a correspondence which might ripen into something more than
an ordinary intimacy between friends? A correspondence was
now begun which lasted for four years, from August 1730 to
July 1734. Mrs. Pendarves, however, remained in widowhood
until 1743, when she married Dr. Delany. A few
extracts, from some of Wesley’s letters to this distinguished
lady, may cast some light upon the questions we have ventured
to suggest, and will also help to illustrate his character
at this important period of his history.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>November 25, 1730.</i>
</p>

<p>“O that our friendship (since you give me leave to use that dear word)
may be built on a firm foundation. For want of humility, I cannot follow
you as I would. I must be left behind in the race of virtue. I am sick
of pride: it quite weighs my spirit down. O, pray for me, that I may be
healed. I have the greater dependence on your intercession, because
you know what you ask. Every line of your last shows the heart of the
writer, where, with friendship, dwells humility. Ours, dear Aspasia, it
is to make acknowledgments; upon us lie the obligations of gratitude.
If it be a fault to have too harmonious a soul, too exquisite a sense of
elegant, generous transports, then, indeed, I must own there is an obvious
fault both in Selina and Aspasia. If not, I fancy one may easily reconcile
whatever they think or act to the strictest reason; unless it be their
entertaining so favourable a thought of their most obliged and most
faithful—<span class="smcap">Cyrus</span>.”</p>

<p class="psig">
“<i>Innocents’ Day, 1730.</i>
</p>

<p>“Should one, who was as my own soul, be torn from me, it would be
best for me. Surely if you were called first, mine eyes ought not to over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>flow
because all tears were wiped away from yours. But I much doubt
whether self-love would not be found too strong for a friendship, which I
even now find to be less disinterested than I hitherto imagined. Is it a
fault to desire to recommend myself to those who so strongly recommend
virtue to me? Tell me, Aspasia,—tell me, Selina,—if it be a fault that
my heart burns within me, when I reflect on the many marks of regard
you have already shown.”</p>
</div>

<p>Aspasia made an inquiry of Wesley, couched in the following
terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every Sunday evening, a gentleman in this town has a concert of
music. I am invited there to-night, and design to go. I charge you, on
the friendship you have professed for me, to tell me your sincere opinion
about it, and all your objections. For, if I am in error by going, you
ought to prevent my doing so again.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley replied:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Far be it from me to think that any circumstance of life shall ever
give the enemy an advantage over Aspasia. He, who has overcome the
world and its princes, shall give His angels charge over her to keep her
in all her ways.</p>

<p>“To judge whether any action be lawful on the sabbath or no, we are
to consider whether it advances the end for which the sabbath was
ordained. Now, the end for which the sabbath was ordained is the
attainment of holiness. Whatever, therefore, tends to advance this end
is lawful on this day. Whatever does not tend to advance this end
is not lawful on this day.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mary Granville spent the summer of 1731 principally in
London, and, to a great extent, in the family of Richard
Colley, Esq., who, three years before, had succeeded to the
estates of his cousin Garrett Wesley, Esq., of the county of
Meath, and had assumed the name and arms of Wesley, and
who, in 1746, was created Baron of Mornington. One day
would be spent in boating upon the Thames, the Duchess of
Ancaster affording them high amusement by singing, or
rather catterwauling, a piece out of the “Beggars’ Opera”;
the next day in witnessing the working of her friend
Wesley’s orrery, and in representing Lady Shelburn at the
baptism of a baby; another day in a jaunt to Greenwich.
Then we find her attending court; and then sitting by the side
of Hogarth, while painting a picture of the Wesley family,
and obtaining a promise that he would give her instructions
in drawing. In the midst of all this fashionable, fluttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
kind of life, John Wesley, at Oxford, was writing her frequent
letters.</p>

<p>Under the date of June 19, he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If Providence has used me as an instrument of doing any good to
Aspasia, I had almost said, ‘I have my reward.’ The thought of having
added anything to your ease will make many of my hours the happier. I
am extremely glad to find you among those few who are yet concerned
for the honour of their Master; and cannot but congratulate you upon
your wise choice. ‘If we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with
Him,’”</p>
</div>

<p>A month later, he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have been charged with being <i>too strict</i>; with carrying things too
far in religion, and laying burdens upon myself, if not on others, which
are neither necessary nor possible to be borne. Do not blame me,
Aspasia, for using every means to find whether I am thus guilty or no;
and particularly for appealing to the judgment of one who, in this, is not
likely to be prejudiced in my favour. Those among whom your lot is
chiefly cast are not accused of too much strictness. Whatever other ill
weeds may flourish there, a court is not a fit soil for these. Give me
leave, then, to lay freely before you what my sentiments in this point are,
and to conjure you to tell me which of them you disapprove.”</p>
</div>

<p>By return of post, on July 21, Aspasia answers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The imputation thrown upon you is a most extraordinary one. But
such is the temper of the world, when you have no vice to feed their
spleen with, they will condemn the highest virtue. O Cyrus, how noble a
defence you make! and how are you adorned with the beauty of holiness!
You really are in a state to be envied. How ardently do I wish to be as
resigned and humble as yourself. As you say, my lot is fallen among
those who cannot be accused of too much strictness in religion; so far
from that, they generally make an open profession of having no religion
at all; and I cannot observe my fellow-creatures in such manifest danger
without feeling an inexpressible concern.”</p>
</div>

<p>Three days later, on July 24, Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am extremely happy in having your approbation, where I am most
careful to be approved. Give me the censure of the many, the praise of
the few. I have all the advantages that outward circumstances can
afford. <i>I</i> spend, day by day, many hours in those employments that
have a direct tendency to improve me. <i>You</i> can rarely have one, wherein
to pursue that great work with the full bent of your mind. <i>I</i> have scarce
any acquaintance in the world, who is not either apt to teach or willing to
learn. <i>You</i> are entangled among several who can plead for themselves
little more than that they do no hurt. And would to God even that plea
would hold! I much fear it will not. Is it no hurt to rob you of your
time, for which there is no equivalent but eternity? Must Aspasia ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
submit to this insupportable misfortune? Every time a gay wretch wants
to trifle away a part of that invaluable treasure which God has lent him,
shall he force away also a part of hers? Surely there is a way to escape.
The God whom you serve point it out to you!”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Aspasia, in other words Mrs. Delany, spent the winter of
1731 in Ireland. On the 11th of March, 1732, writing to her
sister from Dublin, she says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cyrus, by this time, has blotted me out of his memory, or, if he does
remember me, it can only be to reproach me. What can I say for myself,
in having neglected so extraordinary a correspondent? I only am the
sufferer, but I should be very sorry to have him think my silence proceeded
from negligence. I declare it is want of time.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Twelve months after this, while still in Ireland, in another
letter to her sister, she remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As for the ridicule Cyrus has been exposed to, I do not at all wonder
at it. Religion, in its plainest dress, suffers daily from the insolence and
ignorance of the world; then how should that person escape, who dares
to appear openly in its cause? He will meet with all the mortifications
such rebels are able to give, which can be no other than that of finding
them wilfully blinding themselves, and running headlong into the gulf of
perdition; a melancholy prospect for the honest-hearted man who
earnestly desires the salvation of his fellow-creatures.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Here we close these specimens of correspondence. How
are they to be interpreted? When begun, John Wesley was
a young man, twenty-seven years of age, a fellow and tutor
of a college, profoundly pious, and the leader of the Oxford
Methodists. His fair correspondent was a young widow, only
three years older than himself, the niece of Lord Lansdowne,
opulent, talented, accomplished, beautiful, a favourite at court,
and an intimate friend of the gentleman who had succeeded
to the estates of Garrett Wesley, who had wished to make
Wesley’s brother Charles his heir.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Did Wesley correspond
with Aspasia merely for the improvement of himself in piety
and knowledge? And did she correspond with Wesley
merely because she sympathised with the principles and
practices of the Oxford Methodists? To say the least, this is
extremely doubtful. Mary Granville was a talented and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
accomplished woman, but, in that respect, Wesley was greatly
her superior. She was moral, and, upon the whole, religious;
but her life, among her aristocratic friends, was fluttering and
empty when compared with the intensely religious life of
Wesley and his friends at Oxford. The correspondence is a
puzzle. There is nothing that is sickly or merely sentimental;
but, on both sides, there is an endearment which perplexes.
Was Wesley enamoured? And was he groping his way to
something else than ordinary friendship? Did Mary Granville
experience a reciprocity of feeling? And was the reproach,
which began to be heaped upon the Oxford Methodists, the
means of quenching it? We know not. But, supposing such
conjectures to be true, what then? Was Wesley inconsistent
with his principles, or unpardonably ambitious in longing for
such an alliance? Or did Mary Granville at all demean herself
in reciprocating Wesley’s feelings? We think otherwise.
Mary Granville ultimately married Patrick Delany, who, except
that he had become rich by already marrying a wealthy
widow, was, in no respect, the superior of John Wesley; and,
in point of birth, was greatly his inferior; for, while the one
was a son of an eminently learned clergyman of the Established
Church, the other was the son of a servant to an Irish judge.
The suspicions above mentioned are reasonable, though
perhaps not true; and they naturally lead the contemplative
reader to inquire, if Cyrus had married Aspasia, would Oxford
Methodism have grown into what it afterwards became? If,
to use Wesley’s words, Charles Wesley had “a fair escape”
when he declined to become Garrett Wesley’s heir, had not
Wesley himself “a fair escape” when his letters to the intimate
friend of Garrett Wesley’s successor ended as they did?</p>

<p>This is an episode. We return to the Methodism of the
Oxford Methodists.</p>

<p>In 1731, Wesley and his brother began the practice of
conversing with each other in Latin when by themselves, and this
they continued to the end of life. In the same year, a
meeting was held by several of the senior graduates, to consult
on the readiest way to stop the progress of the Methodist
movement; and it was soon publicly reported that the censors
were about to blow up the <i>Godly Club</i>. In April, Wesley,
accompanied by his brother, set out on foot for Epworth; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
after a three weeks’ visit walked the same distance back,
having made two discoveries: 1. That four or five and twenty
miles is an easy and safe day’s journey in hot weather as well
as cold; and, 2. That it was easy to read as they walked, for a
distance of ten or a dozen miles, without feeling either faint
or weary. By this lengthened pedestrian tour they had been
freed from all superfluous humours, and were not now in the
slightest danger of an attack of gout. During their brief
absence, however, their “little company” had “shrunk into
almost none at all; for Mr. Morgan was sick at Holt; Mr.
Boyce at his father’s house at Barton; Mr. Kirkham was
about to leave to become his uncle’s curate; and another
young gentleman of Christ Church had returned to the ways
of the world, and studiously shunned their company.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In August, Wesley, writing to one of his pupils, says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You, who have not the assurance of a day to live, are not wise if you
waste a moment. The shortest way to knowledge seems to be this: 1. To
ascertain what knowledge you desire to attain. 2. To read no book which
does not in some way tend to the attainment of that knowledge. 3. To
read no book which does tend to the attainment of it, unless it be the
best in its kind. 4. To finish one before you begin another. 5. To read
them all in such order, that every subsequent book may illustrate and confirm
the preceding.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the meantime Wesley had begun observing the Wednesday
and Friday fasts, commonly observed in the ancient
church, tasting no food whatever till three in the afternoon.
Some of his friends had left him; but he still diligently
strove against all kinds of sin; omitted no sort of self-denial
which he thought lawful; carefully used, both in public and in
private, all the means of grace; and embraced every opportunity
of doing good.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In 1732, he wrote a sermon on the sacrament of the Lord’s
supper, for the use of his pupils, in which he shows the duty
of all Christians to communicate as often as they can. He
asserts that, with “the first Christians, the Christian sacrifice
was a constant part of the Lord’s day service; and that, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
several centuries, they received it almost daily; four days a
week always, and every saint’s day beside.” He further asserts
that the Church of England has taken “all possible care
that the sacrament be duly administered, wherever the Common-Prayer
is read, every Sunday and holiday in the year;”
and that those who do not receive it, at least thrice in a year,
are liable to excommunication.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>In the same month (February) in which Wesley wrote his
sermon, his mother addressed to him a letter from which we
extract the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The young gentleman you mention seems to me to be in the right
concerning the real presence of Christ in the sacrament. I own, I never
understood by the <i>real presence</i> more than what he has elegantly expressed,
that ‘the Divine nature of Christ is then eminently present, to
impart, by the operation of His Spirit, the benefits of His death to worthy
receivers,’ And surely, the Divine presence of our Lord, thus applying
the virtue and merits of the great atonement to each true believer, makes
the consecrated bread more than a sign of Christ’s body; since, by His so
doing, we receive not only the sign, but with it the thing signified—all the
benefits of His incarnation and passion. But still, however this Divine
institution may seem to others, to me it is full of mystery.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To this Wesley replied as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>February 28, 1732.</i>
</p>

<p>“One consideration is enough to make me assent to your judgment
concerning the holy sacrament; which is, that we cannot allow Christ’s
human nature to be present in it, without allowing either con- or trans-substantiation.
But that His Divinity is so united to us then, as He never
is but to worthy receivers, I firmly believe, though the manner of that
union is utterly a mystery to me.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such was the sacramentarian theory of the high church
Oxford Methodists in 1732.</p>

<p>In the same letter, Wesley introduces another subject,
showing that, after all, his earnest piety was not unmixed
with morbidness. He continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To all who give signs of their not being strangers to the mind of
Christ, I propose this question,—and why not to you rather than any?
shall I quite break off my pursuit of all learning but what immediately
tends to practice? I once desired to make a fair show in language and
philosophy; but it is past; there is a more excellent way; and, if I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
attain to any progress in the one, without throwing up all thoughts of the
other, why, fare it well! Yet a little while, and we shall all be equal in
knowledge, if we are in virtue.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was simply silly and absurd; for, on the same principle,
a man ought to give up business, because business does not
“immediately tend to the practice of piety.”</p>

<p>It has been already stated that, during Wesley’s brief visit
to Epworth, in 1731, the Oxford Methodists were greatly
scattered. In the spring of 1732, their forces were recruited
by the adhesion of Mr. Clayton, and Mr. Broughton, and
half-a-dozen pupils belonging to himself, his brother, and
Mr. Clayton. Six evenings every week were spent, from
six to nine o’clock, partly in reading and considering the
Greek Testament, and partly in close conversation.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>In the month of July, Wesley, being in London, paid a
visit to the Rev. William Law, at Putney, and commenced a
friendship which lasted for several years. From this period,
he began to read the “Theologia Germanica,” and other
mystic writings, with what results will be seen hereafter. On
the 3rd of August, he was made a member of “The Society
for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge;” and, during his
stay in London, received from Mr. Clayton a long letter,
which will help to give the reader an insight into the difficulties
and daily life of the Oxford Methodists. It was first
published in the <i>Wesleyan Times</i> newspaper, of September
24, 1866.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Oxon</span>, <i>August 1, 1732</i>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rev. and Dear Sir</span>,—I cannot but think it an extraordinary
providence, that, when we had lost our best advocate and patron, all
opposition against us should immediately cease. Since you left us, nobody
has thought it worth while to attack either Mr. Smith or me, or to
endeavour to remove us from those principles wherein you, by the grace
of God, have fixed us. Mr. Smith goes out of town to-morrow, and so
will be entirely out of danger from the fellows of Lincoln. He seems to
be forearmed against the temptations which may possibly arise from
strange company and from travelling. My little flock at Brazenose are,
God be praised, true to their principles. Bocardo,” [a room over the
north gate of the city used as a debtors’ prison,] “I fear, grows worse
upon my hands: they have done nothing but quarrel ever since you left
us. They carried matters so high on Saturday, that the bailiff was sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
for, who ordered Tomlyn to be fettered, and put into the dungeon. The
Castle is, I thank God! in much better condition. All the felons were
acquitted, except Salmon, who is to be tried at Warwick; and the sheep-stealer,
who is burnt in the hand and is a great penitent. Jempro is discharged,
and I have appointed Harris to read to the prisoners in his
stead. Two of the felons likewise have paid their fees and are gone out,
both of them able to read mighty well. There are only two in the gaol
who want this accomplishment,—John Clanville, who reads but moderately,
and the horse-stealer who cannot read at all, though he knows all
his letters and can spell most of the monosyllables. I hear them both
read three times a week; and, I believe, Salmon hears them so many
times daily. The woman, who was a perfect novice, spells tolerably; and
so does one of the boys; and the other makes shift to read with spelling
every word that is longer than ordinary. They can both say their
catechism to the end of the commandments, and can likewise repeat the
morning and evening prayers for children in Ken’s Manual. I have been
twice at the school, namely, on Tuesday and Saturday last; and intend
to go again as soon as I have finished this letter. The children all go on
pretty well, except one, who, I find, truants till eleven o’clock in a morning.
I have obtained leave to go to St. Thomas’s workhouse twice a
week. I am sure the people much need instruction, for there is hardly a
soul can read in the whole house. Pray, do not forget a few Common-Prayer
Books for the Castle.</p>

<p>“You cannot imagine the pleasure it is for me to know that you are
engaged every morning in prayer for me. I wish for nine o’clock more
eagerly than ever I did before; and, I think, I begin to perceive what is
meant by that union of souls which is so much talked of in Pere
Malebranche and Madam Bourignon. Mr. Hall is not yet come home;
so that I am pretty much taken up with the poor people and the prisoners.
I thank God, I have fully conquered my affection for a morning nap, and
rise constantly by five o’clock, and have the pleasure to see myself imitated
by the greatest part of my pupils. I have made Mr. Clements a
proselyte to early rising, though I cannot to constant communion. May
God prosper all your designs of doing good in London.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The lull in the opposition to the Oxford Methodists was of
short continuance. A month after the date of Mr. Clayton’s
letter, Wesley had to mourn the death of his friend Morgan,
and to defend himself against the accusation that Morgan
had hastened his death by the rigorous fasting, which he had
practised at Wesley’s recommendation.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Wesley’s long letter
fully satisfied Morgan’s father, who expressed himself as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
almost wishing to be one of the Oxford Methodists himself,
and as ready to vindicate them from any calumny or aspersion
that might be cast upon them.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> There were others, however,
of a different mind, for a fortnight after Mr. Morgan wrote
thus to Wesley, an article appeared in <i>Fogg’s Weekly Journal</i>,
to the effect that there were, in the Oxford University, a
number of persons who, in order “to live up to the principles of
Christianity had doomed themselves to absurd and perpetual
melancholy;” and that “these sons of sorrow designed to
make the whole place a monastery.” The writer continues:
“These Methodists pretend to great refinements, as well as to
what regards the speculative, as the practical part of religion;
and have a very near affinity to the Essenes among the Jews,
and the Pietists in Switzerland. The chief hinge, on which
their whole scheme of religion turns, is, that no action whatever
is indifferent; and hence they condemn several actions
as bad, which are not only allowed to be innocent, but laudable,
by the rest of mankind. They avoid, as much as possible,
every object that may affect them with any pleasant or
grateful sensations. All social entertainments and diversions
are disapproved of; and, in endeavouring to avoid luxury,
they not only exclude what is convenient, but what is absolutely
necessary for the support of life; fancying, (as is
thought,) that religion was designed to contradict nature.
They neglect and voluntarily afflict their bodies, and practise
several rigorous and superstitious customs, which God never
required of them. All Wednesdays and Fridays are strictly to
be kept as fasts; and blood let once a fortnight, to keep down
the carnal man. At dinner, they sigh for the time they are
obliged to spend in eating. Every morning to rise at four
o’clock, is supposed a duty; and to employ two hours a day
in singing of psalms and hymns, is judged an indispensable
requisite to the being a Christian. In short, they practise
everything contrary to the judgment of other persons, and
allow none to have any (religion) but those of their own sect,
which is the farthest from it.</p>

<p>“As these Methodists have occasioned no small stir in
Oxford, so there has not been wanting a variety of conject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>ures
about them. Some are apt to ascribe their gloomy and
disconsolate way of life to want of money; thus being denied
the enjoyment of those pleasures they chiefly desire, they are
weighed down by an habitual sorrow; and it is certain that
their founder took formerly no small liberty in indulging
his appetites. Others tax their characters with hypocrisy,
and suppose them to use religion only as a veil to vice; and,
indeed, if we should give credit to the several tales related of
them, their greatest friends would be ashamed to stand in
their defence. Others judge that their way of life is owing to
enthusiasm, madness, and superstitious scruples. Among
their own party, they pass for religious persons, and men of
extraordinary parts; but they have the misfortune to be
taken by all, who have ever been in their company, for madmen
and fools.”</p>

<p>Such are some of the scandalous charges contained in this
precious epistolary morsel,—we believe the first attack ever
made upon the Methodists in the public prints. The entire
letter is before us; but only a part of it is quoted,—first
because there is a great amount of empty and ungrammatical
verbiage unworthy of being admitted into what was, at that
period, perhaps the most literary and respectable paper published—<i>Fogg’s
Weekly Journal</i>; and secondly because there
is one paragraph, which, despite its verbosity, is so loathsomely
impure, that it would be a sin against both God and man to
reproduce it.</p>

<p>The letter was published in <i>Fogg’s Journal</i>, on December
9th, 1732; and, within two months after, it was answered in
an octavo pamphlet of thirty pages, entitled, “The Oxford
Methodists: Being some account of a society of young
gentlemen in that city, so denominated; setting forth their
rise, views, and designs; in a letter from a gent, near Oxford,
to his friend in London. Printed for J. Roberts, price 6<i>d.</i>”
The second edition of this first defence of Methodism, published
in 1738 “with very great alterations and improvements,”
is that from which the following extracts are taken.</p>

<p>The writer says that he knew nothing of the Methodists till
his friend requested him to make inquiry concerning them.
On doing this, he was first of all told that they were “miserable
enthusiasts and zealots;” and he found that almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
every one, with whom he conversed, had a prejudice against
them; and yet, notwithstanding this, he was unable to learn
that the least slur had been cast upon their moral behaviour,
except that “they pretended to be more pious than their
neighbours,” and that “they put a gloomy and melancholy
face upon religion, and affected greater austerities and exemplariness
than the doctrines of the gospel demanded.”</p>

<p>The writer continues; after he “had heard all that could
be said against them by their enemies,” he “thought it was
but fair to inquire of their friends what could be said in their
favour.” He found it, however, difficult to meet with any who
would acknowledge himself to be a friend; and hence he was
obliged to seek his information from one of the Methodists
themselves. It is probable that Wesley was the Methodist
thus consulted; but, be that as it may, a full account was
given of the origin of Methodism at the end of the year 1729,
and of its progress to the present time. The writer adds:
“The gentleman assured me, that they” (the Methodists)
“were so diffident of themselves, especially when they found
a spirit of contemptuous raillery stirred up against them, that
they took advice from time to time of a worthy and venerable
gentleman, a near relation of one of them, who had much
knowledge and experience of the world; and that they
formed their conduct upon his advice; and, upon the encouragement
he gave them, they were determined, at all
events, to persevere in the course they had begun.”</p>

<p>The “near relation,” referred to in this extract, was Wesley’s
father; and the extract is of vast importance as tending to
confirm the opinion that the “father of the Wesleys”—the
noble-hearted rector of Epworth—deserves more credit for the
organisation and establishment of Oxford Methodism than
the Methodists and the Church have ever yet awarded him.
Several of his “encouraging epistles” were shown to the inquiring
writer of the pamphlet before us, and gave him “a
high notion of the piety and good sense of the venerable
author.” “How happy,” he writes, “are these sacramentarians,
these Methodists, these enthusiasts, as their enemies
call them, to have so very excellent a director! and how
much are they to be commended for submitting their conduct
and designs to so pious and experienced a judge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>He then proceeds: “There are three points to which these
gentlemen think themselves obliged to adhere—1. That of
visiting and relieving the prisoners and the sick, and giving
away Bibles, Common-Prayer Books, and the ‘Whole Duty of
Man’; and of explaining the catechism to the children of
poor families, and of dropping a shilling or so to such families
where they deem it needful. 2. That of weekly communion.
3. That of observing strictly the fasts of the Church, which
has caused some to call them ‘Supererogation Men.’”</p>

<p>After this, the writer proceeds to notice the accusations
contained in the letter published in <i>Fogg’s Weekly Journal</i>,
and, as far as necessary, replies to them.</p>

<p>Such is an outline of the first defence of Methodism ever
published.</p>

<p>Wesley, in 1733, composed two sermons full of a great
doctrine, which had well-nigh been forgotten—the absolute
need of the influences of the Holy Ghost to convert the soul.
It is a gross mistake to imagine that this, with its cognate
truths, was not discovered and embraced by Wesley until his
meeting with Peter Bohler in 1738. Take the following
extracts from the first of the sermons above mentioned, and
which was preached at St. Mary’s, Oxford, before the university,
on January 1st, 1733.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>“The circumcision of the heart is that habitual disposition
of soul, which, in the sacred writings, is termed holiness; and
which directly implies the being cleansed from sin, from all
filthiness both of flesh and spirit; and, by consequence, the
being endued with those virtues which were also in Christ
Jesus; the being so renewed in the image of our mind,
as to be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect.”</p>

<p>Here we have propounded, in the plainest terms, as early
as the year 1733, Wesley’s famous doctrine of Christian
perfection. “This sermon,” said he, in 1765, “contained all
that I now teach concerning salvation from all sin, and loving
God with an undivided heart.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>In the same sermon he tells us that, “without the Spirit of
God we can do nothing but add sin to sin; it being as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
impossible for us even to think a good thought without His
supernatural assistance, as to create ourselves, or to renew
our whole souls in righteousness and true holiness. He alone
can quicken those who are dead unto God, and breathe into
them the breath of Christian life.”</p>

<p>We are further taught that this holiness of heart is to be
obtained “alone by faith, which is not only an unshaken
assent to all that God hath revealed in Scripture, but in
particular to those important truths,—‘Jesus Christ came
into the world to save sinners,’—‘He bare our sins in His
own body on the tree,’—‘He is the propitiation for our sins;
and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole
world.’”</p>

<p>Then follows: “Those who are thus, by faith, born of God,
have also strong consolation through hope. This is the next
thing which the circumcision of the heart implies; even the
testimony of their own spirit, with the Spirit which witnesses
in their hearts, that they are the children of God.”</p>

<p>Then, as if intended to answer one of the false accusations
which had appeared in <i>Fogg’s Weekly Journal</i> only three
weeks before, and to justify one of the practices there condemned,
he tells his reverend and learned auditors that this
heart religion “does not forbid us, as some have strangely
imagined, to take pleasure in anything but God; to suppose
this, is to suppose the Fountain of holiness is directly the
author of sin; since He has inseparably annexed pleasure
to the use of those creatures which are necessary to sustain
the life He has given us.” But, at the same time, “every
good soldier of Christ will not only renounce the works of
darkness, but every appetite too, and every affection, which is
not subject to the law of God. Vain hope! that a child of
Adam should ever expect to see the kingdom of Christ and
of God, without striving, without agonizing first, to enter in at
the strait gate,—without a constant and continued course
of general self-denial.”</p>

<p>“This,” adds Wesley, “is God’s short and plain account of
true religion and virtue. Other sacrifices from us He would
not; but the living sacrifice of the heart He hath chosen.
Let it be continually offered up to God through Christ, in
flames of holy love. And let no creature be suffered to share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
with Him; for He is a jealous God. His throne will He not
divide with another; He will reign without a rival. Be no
design, no desire admitted there, but what has Him for its
ultimate object. This is the way wherein those children of
God once walked, who, being dead, still speak to us.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Such then were the principles held by Wesley and the
Oxford Methodists, in 1733. From these he never varied;
and dark will be the day when they are either abandoned or
forgotten by his followers.</p>

<p>The other sermon, written in 1733, was founded upon the
text, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are
sealed unto the day of redemption.” Here again we are
told that the Holy Spirit “is the great Fountain of holiness
to His church. From Him flows all the grace and virtue, by
which the stains of guilt are cleansed, and we are renewed in
all holy dispositions, and again bear the image of our Creator.
He is the immediate Minister of God’s will upon earth, and
transacts all the great affairs of the church of Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Precious truths are truths like these. Without them the
church, no matter how learned, rich, respectable, and ritualistic,
is utterly powerless in converting men. With them,
nothing is impossible; for, in such a case, the church has, for
the accomplishment of its purposes, not only the resources of
man, but the omnipotence of God.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1733, Wesley issued his first printed production,
“A Collection of Forms of Prayer for every day in the
Week.” These prayers were originally intended for the use of
his college pupils; but the reader may also gather from them
some of the principles and aims of the Oxford Methodists.</p>

<p>They longed for the love of God to be the sole actuating
power in the use they made of their understanding, affections,
senses, health, time, and talents; that God might always be
present to their minds; that they might ever have awful
thoughts of Him, and never mention His holy and reverend
name, unless on just, solemn, and devout occasions; nor even
then, without acts of adoration; and that they might glorify
Him by every thought of their hearts, every word of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
tongues, and every work of their hands, and by professing
His truth, even to the death, if it should please Him to call
them to it.</p>

<p>They wished to be made all kindness and benignity, all
goodness and gentleness, all meekness and longsuffering; and
to be filled with the whole spirit of humility, and to have it
the constant, ruling habit of their minds. They dreaded applause,
and desired never to speak a word that might tend to
their own praise, unless the good of others required it. They
endeavoured to abstain from all pleasures which did not prepare
them for taking pleasure in God.</p>

<p>They acted upon the principle of excluding none from their
charity, who were the objects of God’s mercy. They embraced
all occasions to assist the needy, to protect the oppressed, to
instruct the ignorant, to confirm the wavering, to exhort the
good, and to reprove the wicked. They wished to look upon
the failings of their neighbours as if they were their own; and
never revealed them but when charity required, and then with
tenderness and compassion.</p>

<p>Space forbids further reference to these prayers. Suffice it
to say that, for reverential feeling, simplicity and beauty of
expression, scriptural sentiment, Christian benevolence, and
earnest longings for the highest holiness; for adoration, penitence,
deprecation, petition, thanksgiving, and intercession,—they
have no superiors, perhaps hardly any equals, in the
English language. They are little known, and less used; but
would be of great service to thousands of Methodists, if
sometimes employed as an aid in their private devotions.</p>

<p>In January, 1733, Wesley set out on horseback for Epworth,
to see his father, whose health was failing; and, on his way,
had a narrow escape, by his horse falling over a bridge, not far
from Daventry. His parents suggested to him the propriety
of using means to obtain the Epworth living; but he was
deterred from acquiescing in the proposal, by a conviction
that, “if he could stand his ground at Oxford, and approve
himself a faithful minister of Christ, through evil report and
good report, there was no place under heaven where he was
so likely to make improvement in every good work.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>In May, he again went to Epworth, visiting, on the
way, his friend Clayton, at Manchester, where he spent a
sabbath, and preached thrice, in three different churches.
On his return to Oxford, in June, he found the ill effects
of his absence; for three of his own pupils and the whole
of Mr. Clayton’s had abandoned the Methodists; and, instead
of finding seven-and-twenty communicants at St.
Mary’s, he now found not more than five. His friends were
deserting him, and his enemies triumphing over him; but, in
the midst of all, he stood unmoved. “My friends,” says he,
“were either trifling or serious: if triflers, fare them well; a
noble escape: if serious, those who are more serious are left,
whom the others would rather have opposed than forwarded in
the service they have done, and still do, us. As for reputation,
though it be a glorious instrument of advancing our Master’s
service, yet there is a better than that—a clean heart, a single
eye, a soul full of God.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> “The thing that gives offence here
is the being singular with regard to time, expense, and company.
Ill men say all manner of evil of me, and good men
believe them. There is a way, and there is but one, of making
my peace. God forbid I should ever take it. I have as many
pupils as I need, and as many friends; when more are better
for me, I shall have more. If I have no more pupils after
these are gone from me, I shall then be glad of a curacy
near you; if I have, I shall take it as a signal to remain
here. What I do is this; when I am entrusted with a person
who is first to understand and practise, and then to teach,
the law of Christ, I endeavour to show him what that law is.
When he appears seriously sensible of this, I propose to him
the means God hath commanded him to use, in order to that
end; and a week, or a month, or a year after, as the state
of his soul seems to require it, the several prudential means
recommended by wise and good men. Only two rules it is
my principle to observe in all cases; first, to begin, continue,
and end all my advices in the spirit of meekness; and
secondly, to add to meekness long suffering; in pursuance of
a rule which I fixed long since, never to give up any one till I
have tried him at least ten years.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>These are significant facts. Methodism at Oxford was
organised in 1729. Two years after, while Wesley and his
brother were at Epworth, it dwindled into almost nothing; and
two years later still, when it had increased to seven-and-twenty
communicants, during another brief Epworth visit it was
almost utterly destroyed, for the seven-and-twenty were reduced
to five. All this goes to show that Wesley was the
soul of this mighty movement, and that without him it would
have been dissolved and become extinct.</p>

<p>It is far from certain that the seven-and-twenty communicants,
just mentioned, were all collegians. On the contrary,
there is strong presumptive proof that they were not; and,
indeed, that some of them were ladies. One of them seems
to have been Miss Potter, probably the bishop’s daughter,
concerning whom Clayton writes to Wesley, in a letter dated
“Manchester, September 10, 1733,” as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Poor Miss Potter! I wonder not that she is fallen. Where humility
is not the foundation, the superstructure cannot be good. And yet I am
sorry to hear the tidings of her, especially that she has a great man for her
confessor, who dissuades her from constant communion. I am sure she
has great occasion to use all the means of grace which Providence
provides for her. I would not persuade you to leave off reading with her.
Who knows whether you may not raise her again to the eminence from
which she has fallen? At least, though she neglect the weightier matters
of the law, yet keep up in her that reverend respect she bears it, even by
the ‘tithing of mint and anise and cummin.’”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whether there were other ladies besides this one, included
in the seven-and-twenty Methodist communicants, it is impossible
to say; but none were included in the five. The
five poor Methodists remaining, not reckoning Wesley himself,
nor Morgan who was dead, nor Clayton who was removed
to Manchester, nor Whitelamb who was gone to Wroote,
were doubtless Charles Wesley, Benjamin Ingham<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and
James Hervey (both of whom joined them in 1733), John
Gambold, and, probably, Charles Kinchin. All honour to
such names! They kept the fire burning when it was in
danger of going out. Wesley was their master spirit; but
they were faithful and willing co-workers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Clayton, in the letter just quoted, refers to confession
and to constant communion. Did the Oxford Methodists
recommend confession? It would seem they did; hence the
following extract from a long, unpublished letter, written at
this period, and addressed to Wesley, by his sister Emily:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To lay open the state of my soul to you, or any of our clergy, is what
I have no inclination to at present; and, I believe, I never shall. I shall
not put my conscience under the direction of mortal man, frail as myself.
To my own master I stand or fall. Nay, I scruple not to say, that all
such desire in you, or any other ecclesiastic, seems to me like church
tyranny, and assuming to yourselves a dominion over your fellow-creatures,
which was never designed you by God.... I farther own that I do not
hold frequent communion necessary to salvation, nor a means of Christian
perfection. But do not mistake my meaning; I only think communing
every Sunday, or very frequently, lessens our veneration for that sacred
ordinance, and, consequently, our profiting by it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Two other extracts from letters, belonging to this period,
may be useful as illustrative of Oxford Methodism. In the
month of July, 1733, Mr. Clayton, then resident in Manchester,
wrote to Wesley as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to your question about Saturday, I can only answer it by giving an
account of how I spend the day. I do not look upon it as a preparation
for Sunday, but as a festival itself; and, therefore, I have continued
festival prayer, for the three primitive hours, and for morning and evening,
from the Apostolical Constitutions, which, I think, I communicated to you
whilst I was at Oxford. I look upon Friday as my preparation for the
celebration of both the sabbath and the Lord’s day; the first of which I
observe much like a common saint’s day, or as one of the inferior
holidays of the Church. I have, I bless God! generally contrived to have
the eucharist celebrated on Saturdays as well as other holidays, for
the use of myself and the sick people whom I visit.</p>

<p>“I was at Dr. Deacon’s when your letter came to hand, and we had a
deal of talk about your scheme of avowing yourselves as a society, and
fixing upon a set of rules. The Doctor seemed to think you had better
let it alone; for to what end would it serve? It would be no additional
tie upon yourselves; and perhaps would be a snare for the consciences
of those weak brethren who might chance to come among you. Observing
the stations” [the fast on Wednesdays and Fridays] “and weekly communion
are duties which stand upon a much higher footing than a rule of
society; and they who can set aside the command of God and the
authority of the Church will hardly, I doubt, be tied by the rules of a
private society.</p>

<p>“As to the mixture” [of water with sacramental wine] “Mr. Colley
told me it was constantly used at Christ Church. However, if you have
reason to doubt it, I would have you inquire; but I cannot think the want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
of it a reason for not communicating. If I could receive where the mixture
was used, I would; and, therefore, I used to prefer the Castle to Christ
Church; but if not I should not think myself any further concerned in
the matter than as it might be in my power to get it restored.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Again, in another letter, dated “Manchester, September
10, 1733,” Mr. Clayton writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How should I direct my instructor in the school of Christ! However,
I must be free to tell you my sentiments of what you inquire about. On
Wednesdays and Fridays I have, for some time past, used the Office for
Passion Week, out of Spinckes’s Devotions, and bless God for it. I have
found it very useful to excite in me that love of God, and that sorrow
for having offended Him, which make up the first main branch of repentance.
Refer your last question to Mr. Law; I dare not give directions
for spending that time which I consume in bed, nor teach you, who rise at
four, when I indulge myself in sleep till five.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These are important letters, not only as exhibiting the
religious earnestness of Wesley and his friends, but as
affording a glimpse of the high churchism of the Oxford
Methodists. Wesley seriously contemplated the formation
of a society, who should strictly observe saint days, holidays,
and Saturdays, besides other ritualistic practices, down to
superstitious admixture of sacramental wine with water. In
truth, these were ardent spirits. Visiting prisons, and teaching
children; rising at five every morning; praying for each
other and for their friends; and observing the weekly communion,
are things which all will regard with commendation:
but the other were silly, popish practices, not only unauthorised
and useless, but too much resembling the pernicious
nonsense of the high church party of the present day to
receive the approval of those who have learned to be
thankful for the inestimable blessings of the great Protestant
reformation.</p>

<p>The health of Wesley’s father was now extremely feeble;
and it became an anxiously discussed family question whether
Wesley should be his father’s successor. Samuel was first
urged to use means to obtain the next presentation of the
Epworth rectory; but he positively declined doing so, and
directed his father’s attention to John. The correspondence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
on this subject extends over the whole of the year 1734. The
Epworth living was valuable, as may be judged by the
fact that, though then worth only £200 per annum, it is now,
through the relative changes that have taken place in the
value of money and the price of food, worth near £1000.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
The dying rector had been at great expense in improving
the parsonage and its premises. Here he had diligently and
faithfully laboured as an earnest parish minister for nearly forty
successive years. Here most of his nineteen children had
been born. Here he was about to die himself; and here he
was anxious that his wife should die. John was pressed
to secure the living, and thereby secure a continuance of the
old homestead for his mother and his unmarried sisters. His
brother Samuel allowed that at Oxford he would have “more
friends, more freedom from care, and more Divine ordinances
than he could have elsewhere;” but then at Oxford he was
“despised,” and therefore could “do no good there.” To this
John answered: “1. A Christian will be despised anywhere.
2. No one is a Christian till he is despised. 3. His being
despised will not hinder his doing good, but much further it,
by making him a better Christian. 4. Another can supply
my place at Epworth better than at Oxford, and the good
done here is of a far more diffusive nature; inasmuch as it is
a more extensive benefit to sweeten the fountain than to do
the same to particular streams.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>In writing to his father, he put the case thus: “The question
is not whether I could do more good to others there or
here; but whether I could do more good to myself: seeing
wherever I can be most holy myself, there I can most promote
holiness in others. But I can improve myself more at Oxford
than at any other place,” etc.</p>

<p>To this his father properly replied that our main consideration
in choosing a course of life “is not dear self, but the glory
of God, and the different degrees of promoting it.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>John agreed to this; but argued that “that course of life
tends most to the glory of God, wherein we can most promote
holiness in ourselves and others;” and that at Oxford he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
several advantages for doing this which were almost peculiar
to the place. 1. He could always have at hand half-a-dozen
friends, nearly of his own judgment, and engaged in the same
studies; persons who had wholly and absolutely devoted
themselves to God, and who denied themselves and took up
their cross daily. 2. He could not only have as much, but as
little company as he pleased; for he had no trifling visitors,
except about an hour in a month, when he invited some of
the fellows to breakfast. 3. He was entirely free from worldly
cares, for his income was ready for him on stated days, and
all he had to do was to count it and carry it home. 4. He
had the privilege of public prayer twice a day, and of weekly
communion. 5. At Oxford there was room for charity in all
its forms; poor families to be relieved; children to be educated;
workhouses and prisons to be visited; and the schools
of the prophets, where tender minds were to be formed and
strengthened. 6. He had the joint advice of many friends in
any difficulty that might arise; the good bishop and vice-chancellor
to supply his want of experience; and a fund,
which this year would amount to near £80, to supply the
bodily wants of the poor, and thereby prepare their souls to
receive instruction. In addition to all this, he alleges that the
care of two thousand souls at Epworth would crush him; and
that, were he to abandon all his Oxford advantages, he would
not be able to stand his ground for a single month against
intemperance in sleeping, eating, and drinking; against irregularity
in study; against a general lukewarmness in his
affections, and remissness in his actions; against softness and
self-indulgence, directly opposite to that discipline and hardship
which become a soldier of Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The letter from which the above is taken is dated December
10, 1734. His brother Samuel wrote a fortnight later,
saying that his father had told him John was unalterably
resolved not to accept the living, even if he could get it.
Samuel protests against the decision, and says that in Wesley’s
arguments he can see his love to himself, but he cannot see
his love to his neighbour. Besides, he was not at liberty to
resolve against undertaking a cure of souls, having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
solemnly engaged to do this at his ordination. Charles
might be silly enough to vow he would not depart from
Oxford, and thereby avoid orders; but the faith of John was
already plighted to the contrary; and the idea scarce ever
entered the head of any Christian but his own, that a parish
priest cannot attain to the highest perfection possible on this
side heaven.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s reasons and arguments were doubtless well intended;
but they were feeble, sophistical, and inconclusive.
It is easy to imagine that they would be painful both to his
father and family; and it seems impossible to excuse them
except upon the ground that God had elected him for another
kind of work, and that by an unseen power he was prevented
realising his father’s wishes. Wesley’s father died April 25,
1735, and the Epworth living passed into other hands; but
before proceeding farther, we give the last letter Wesley
received from him.</p>

<p>The venerable rector was now anxiously employed in the
publication of his grand folio volume of 600 pages, “<i>Dissertationes
in Librum Jobi</i>,” and had requested his son to assist
him with the engravings for it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Epworth</span>, <i>January 21, 1735</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Son</span>,—About an hour since, your letter of the 13th instant
came to hand, and indeed not before I had need of it, especially when
I considered how extremely weak I was, and found myself grow sensibly
weaker every day. My people have been very kind to me during
my long illness, which has brought me now so low that I cannot walk half-a-dozen
times about my chamber; but then I am often refreshed with
seeing Mr. Hale’s noble present of books to me lying in my window, near
half of which I have already spread in my parish, some to those who came
to see me, and to others I have sent them, and with very good effect,
many having read them, and some lent them to others. A spirit of
Christianity, beyond what I have hitherto known, seems to be raised
among them; one proof of which is in the greater frequency of the sacraments.
Nor is Mr. Whitelamb wanting in any part of his duty, though I
am not able to preach or give the sacrament to them myself, except one
day, and that with his assistance.</p>

<p>“And now let us go on to matter of less moment, though I hope not quite
frivolous. Had I had all Mr. Rivington’s advice at first, all my plates and
cuts would have been done before this, and that with less expense, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
greater perfection. The agreement you have made with the engraver
seems to be very reasonable. Whether the cuts are to be done on sheets
or half sheets I leave to you and Mr. Rivington; but I would have
leviathan’s rival, that is, the whale, as well as the crocodile. As for the
elephant, he is so common that he need not be added. I am glad the
tombs want no more than retouching, and especially that Mr. Garden is
not ill pleased with them. ‘Job in Adversity’ I leave to your direction, as
likewise the frontispiece, which Mr. Virtue is doing, who now duns me
pretty hard for money for it; and I have writ him lately to send me word
what he will charge for the whole when it is finished, and what he desires
in part, with a promise to send him some money by the first opportunity
I have of doing it. As for poor Pentapolis, it must even shift as it can,
though my heart is pretty much in it, and I have taken a little pains
about it. This I must likewise leave with you; but cannot you send
me a copy of the drawings before they are engraven, that I may weigh
them, as is proper? As for Job’s horse, I cannot for my life imagine
how I shall get him into my Lord Oxford’s stable,—I mean, get liberty
to inscribe it to him, unless you yourself would speak to my Lord Duplin
about it. Have you yet found any news of ‘<i>De Morbo Jobi</i>,’ which
has been so long incognito? Or, is there anything else that you find
wanting? I heartily commend you and your brother to God, and am
this evening</p>

<p class="psig">
Your affectionate father,<br />
<span class="smcap">Samuel Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley endorsed this characteristic letter from his father
with the words, “The last I received from him.” Thirteen
weeks afterwards, the venerable man rested from his cares and
earthly labours.</p>

<p>On June 11, 1734, Wesley preached before the university
what his brother Charles calls “his Jacobite sermon,” for
which he was “much mauled and threatened.” He was
prudent enough, however, before preaching it, to get the vice-chancellor
to read and approve of it, and hence was able to
set “Wadham, Merton, Exeter, and Christ Church” objectors
at defiance.</p>

<p>He then set out for Epworth, accompanied by Westley
Hall, who proposed marriage to his sister Keziah, greatly to
the satisfaction of all the parties concerned, except Hall’s own
mother. On his return to Oxford, he spent some time in
London, chiefly in consulting Mr. Law about one of his
pupils, referred to in Wesley’s Works, vol. xii., p. 46; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
also partly in putting through the press his father’s “Dissertations
on the Book of Job.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>About the same period, he began the practice of reading as
he rode on horseback,—a practice he continued nearly forty
years. He also made frequent excursions to different parts of
the country, often on foot; and, during the year, walked more
than a thousand miles, constantly preaching on the sabbath,
and already acting the part of an itinerant. His walking,
preaching, reading, studying, visiting, and fasting began to
affect his health; he lost his strength, and frequently spat
blood.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> On the 16th of July, while asleep in bed, he had such
an attack of bleeding as led him to exclaim: “O God, prepare
me for Thy coming, and then come when Thou wilt!” His
friends became alarmed; and his mother wrote letters blaming
him for neglecting his health. A physician was called in, his
advice adopted, and gradually the well worn devotee regained
his lost vigour.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Though Wesley’s letter to his father, dated December 10,
1734, seemed to decide the question respecting his seeking to
obtain the Epworth living, his brother Samuel, during the
correspondence arising out of it, started an idea which, ghost
like, haunted Wesley for months afterwards, and which, we
incline to think, had considerable influence in inducing him to
change his views, and ultimately to go to Georgia.</p>

<p>Samuel, on Christmas-day, 1734, wrote as follows:—“You
are not at liberty to resolve against undertaking a cure of
souls. You are solemnly engaged to do it before God, and
His high-priest, and His Church. Are you not ordained?
Did you not deliberately and openly promise to instruct, to
teach, to admonish, to exhort those committed to your charge?
Did you equivocate then with so vile a reservation, as to
purpose in your heart that you would never have a charge?
It is not a college, it is not an university; it is the <i>order of
the Church</i>, according to which you were called.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>This was touching Wesley in a tender place. On conscientious
grounds, he had already refused to apply for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Epworth living; and yet here his brother Samuel maintains
that on conscientious grounds, he is bound not to bury himself
at Oxford, but to undertake a cure of souls, either at Epworth
or somewhere else. His faith is plighted. Before God
and His Church he has sworn to be, not a tutor, but a minister
of Christ. What was the effect of this? In December, 1734,
Wesley refused to apply for his father’s living; and yet, ten
months afterwards, he left Oxford and set sail to Georgia.
What occurred during this brief interval?</p>

<p>In January, 1735, Wesley wrote to Samuel, saying:—“I do
not, nor ever did, resolve against undertaking a cure of souls.
There are four cures belonging to our college, and consistent
with a fellowship. I do not know but I may take one of them
at Michaelmas. Not that I am clearly assured that I should
be false to my engagement, were I only to instruct and exhort
the pupils committed to my charge. But of that I should
think more. I desire your full thoughts upon the whole, as
well as your prayers.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>To this Samuel replied, February 8, 1735:—“<i>The order of
the Church</i> stakes you down, and the more you struggle you
will be held the faster. If there be such a thing as truth, I
insist upon it, you must, when opportunity offers, either perform
that promise, or repent of it.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>In answer, five days afterwards, John remarked:—“Your
last argument is either <i>ignoratio elenchi</i>, or implies these two
propositions: 1. ‘You resolve against any parochial cure of
souls.’ 2. ‘The priest who does not undertake the first parochial
cure that offers is perjured.’ Let us add a third: ‘The
tutor who, being in orders, never accepts of a parish is perjured.’
And then I deny all three.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Samuel’s reply was as follows:—“An ordained tutor, who
accepts not a cure, is perjured; alter the term into ‘who
resolves not to accept,’ and I will maintain it, unless you can
prove either of these two: (1) there is no such obligation at
taking orders; (2) this obligation is dispensed with. Both
which I utterly deny.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>On the 4th of March John replied:—“I had rather dispute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
with you, if I must dispute, than with any man living; because
it may be done with so little expense of time and words. You
think I engaged myself at my ordination to undertake the
cure of a parish. I think I did not. However, I own I am
not the proper judge of the oath I then took; accordingly,
the post after I received yours, I referred it to ‘the high-priest
of God,’ before whom I contracted that engagement,
proposing this single question to him,—Whether I had, at my
ordination, engaged myself to undertake the cure of a parish
or no. His answer runs in these words: ‘It doth not seem
to me that, at your ordination, you engaged yourself to undertake
the cure of any parish, provided you can, as a clergyman,
better serve God and His Church in your present or
some other station.’ Now, that I can, as a clergyman, better
serve God and His Church in my present station, I have all
reasonable evidence.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s father died within two months after this; and yet,
during this short interval, Wesley seems to have been induced
to lay aside his scruples and to apply for the Epworth living.
He applied, but he was not successful. This is a bold assertion
to be made in the teeth of statements directly opposite; statements
made and repeated and re-repeated, without dispute,
for more than the last seventy years: but before the reader
rejects it, let him ponder the significance of the following letter,
written by Wesley’s friend, Broughton, and published, for
the first time, in the <i>Wesleyan Times</i>, of October 28, 1861:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>April 15, 1735</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,—The same evening I received the favour of
yours, I waited on St. John, promising myself a kind reception. He rejoiced
with me to hear that your father was yet alive; but did not close
readily with me in attempting what, if crowned with success, might prove
a means of making our declining friend end his days in peace. What
shall we say for so sudden, so unwished for a change? Oh, put not your
trust in princes! St. John disowns his giving me any encouragement to
promise you hopes of success. Did I then write you an untruth? If his
charge be just, I did; but his words were, ‘though he had solicited the
Bishop of London and Sir Robert on behalf of another, not for Epworth,
yet he would be glad to serve Mr. Wesley.’ But where is the obstacle?
Why, my lord of London, who is usually consulted by the minister of
state on such occasions, spoke some disadvantageous things of you once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
in the presence of St. John. But I could not but observe to our friend
that the misrepresented strictness of life, which gave occasion for these
disadvantageous things to be spoken of you, was so far from being an
objection to your being favoured by a Christian bishop, that I humbly
hoped it would turn to your good account, inasmuch as over exactness of
behaviour was the sign of a tender and well regulated mind. But I cannot
here help thinking, ‘<i>Tros Tyriusve illi nullo discrimine agetur</i>.’ St. John
thinks the Bishop of Oxford can be your friend. Yes, I told him, my lord
might give you a favourable word, if asked; but I did not think the interest
in his lordship was so prevalent as to make him bestir himself on
your behalf. However, if you judge it proper to write to the bishop, I
will wait upon him, and do the best I can to serve my dear friend.</p>

<p>“Could your father’s book be presented to the queen soon? It might
do good. Do you know any great man about the court? The king is not
so difficult (I hope), if one could get a hearty friend to espouse you. My
interest in the speaker is not powerful enough to bring about so desired a
work; yet if there was any other great man to befriend you, a serviceable
hint might be dropped. I doubt not but our good and loving God will
order this and everything else for your great and best good. This is the
wish and prayer of, dear sir,</p>

<p class="psig">
“Yours most sincerely,<br />
<br />
“<span class="smcap">J. Broughton</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Broughton was now curate at the Tower, in London.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, was a politician of
great ability and power. Sir Robert Walpole was prime
minister. The Bishop of London was the celebrated Edmund
Gibson. The Epworth living was a gift of the crown. Bear
these facts in mind, and the above epistle will be easily interpreted.</p>

<p>Wesley’s objections to leave Oxford being overcome, probably
by the hard facts and logic of his brother Samuel, he
took steps to become his father’s successor. Broughton, who
was evidently a man of influence and position, was employed
to secure the help of Bolingbroke; and Bolingbroke had promised
to use his endeavours to serve Wesley; but, on being
pressed to fulfil his promise, shrank from doing so, on the
ground that he had heard Gibson speak disparagingly of
Wesley in Walpole’s presence; and, as the next presentation
of the Epworth living was, <i>ipso facto</i>, at the disposal of these
two dignitaries, it was almost useless to bring before them
Wesley’s wish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Broughton suggests two other steps to be taken, which
might be of service in securing the living: (1) that the good
services of the Bishop of Oxford be solicited; and (2) that
the dying rector’s “Dissertations on the Book of Job,” dedicated
to Queen Caroline, might be presented to her majesty
as soon as possible. To adopt the second of these suggestions
was impracticable, as the work was only in the course of being
printed, and the first opportunity of presenting a copy to the
queen did not occur until six months after the rector’s death.
Whether the first was carried out we have no means of
knowing.</p>

<p>The reader will excuse these lengthy observations, on the
ground that they help to clear up what has always been a
somewhat painfully mysterious chapter in Wesley’s history.
It is not true that he could not be induced to apply for his
father’s living. Indirectly, at least, he did apply, but failed;
and, remembering this, the wonder is not so great that a few
months afterwards he embarked for Georgia.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Little more remains to be said before accompanying Wesley
on his mission.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this correspondence respecting the
Epworth rectory, that George Whitefield was introduced to
Wesley’s acquaintance, and became one of the Oxford Methodists.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Three years before, Whitefield had been admitted a
servitor of Pembroke College, and had begun to pray and
sing psalms five times every day. He longed to be acquainted
with the Methodists, and often watched them passing, through
ridiculing crowds, to receive the sacrament at St. Mary’s;
but he was a poor youth, the servitor of other students, and
shrunk from obtruding himself upon their notice. At length,
a woman, in one of the workhouses, attempted to cut her
throat; and Whitefield sent an apple-seller, attached to
Pembroke College, to inform Charles Wesley of her condition;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
and this led Charles to invite him to breakfast next morning.
He was now introduced to the rest of the Methodists, and
adopted all their rules. The master of his college threatened
to expel him. Some of the students shot at him their shafts
of ridicule; others threw dirt at him; and others took away
their pay from him. Being in great distress about his soul, he
lay whole days prostrate on the ground, in silent or vocal
prayer; he chose the worst sort of food; he fasted twice a
week; he wore woollen gloves, a patched gown, and dirty
shoes; and, as a penitent, thought it unbecoming to have his
hair powdered. Like all his brother Methodists, he observed
Lent with the greatest severity, eating no flesh during the six
weeks, except on Saturdays and Sundays. On the other days,
his only food was coarse bread, and sage tea without sugar.
Abstinence and inward conflicts brought on illness; but, after
about seven weeks, he was enabled to lay hold on Christ by a
living faith, was filled with peace and joy, and became probably
by far the most happy member of the Oxford brotherhood.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Mention has been already made of the first of Wesley’s
publications,—his “Forms of Prayer,” printed in 1733. In
1735 he issued three others.</p>

<p>First, “A Sermon on the Trouble and Rest of Good Men,
preached at St. Mary’s, Oxford, on Sunday, September 21st,
and published at the request of several of the hearers.”
London: C. Rivington. 1735. This sermon, in two respects,
is remarkable; (1) for its un-Wesleyan theology; (2) for its
boldly bearding Methodist persecutors in their head-quarters.
The preacher tells his hearers that “perfect holiness is not
found on earth; but death will destroy, at once, the whole
body of sin, and therewith its companion—pain.” Two years
before, in his sermon on “The Circumcision of the Heart,”
Wesley had given a beautiful definition of “holiness;” but
here he teaches that this holiness is not attainable in life; not
until the hour of death; a different doctrine this to that which
he afterwards embodied in his “Plain Account of Christian
Perfection.” But however much the preacher lacked theological
correctness, there was no lack of heroic daring: remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
that, for six years past, he and his associates had been
the constant butt of collegiate scorn and ridicule, and that
his present congregation, in a great degree, consisted of those
who had thought it a privilege to make themselves witty at his
expense; one cannot but admire his pluck in telling them,
face to face, that, “as at first, he that was born after the flesh
persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now,
and so it must be, till all things are fulfilled. Despisers were
now multiplied upon the earth, who feared not the Son, neither
the Father; but blasphemed the Lord and His Anointed;
either reviling the whole of His glorious gospel, or making
Him a liar as to some of the blessed truths revealed therein.
But in heaven good men are hid from the scourge of the
tongue. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets do not
revile, or separate them from their company. They are no
longer despitefully used, and persecuted; neither do they
groan under the hand of the oppressor. In a word, in heaven
there is no earthly or sensual, no devilish spirit; none who do
not love the Lord their God with all their heart.”</p>

<p>The second of Wesley’s publications, in 1735, was “The
Christian’s Pattern; or, a Treatise of the Imitation of Christ.
Written originally in Latin by Thomas à Kempis. With a
Preface containing an Account of the Usefulness of this
Treatise. Compared with the original, and corrected throughout.
By John Wesley, M.A.” London: C. Rivington. Of this
work he, at the same time, published two editions,—one in
8vo, 319 pages, with five engravings; and the other in 24mo,
344 pages, with a frontispiece.</p>

<p>His third publication was a manuscript written by his
father, and was entitled, “Advice to a Young Clergyman. By
a Divine of the Church of England.” 12mo, 76 pages.</p>

<p>We now bid adieu to Oxford. We have seen Methodism at
its fountain-head; we must hereafter trace it, in its streams of
blessing, all the wide world over. The principles and practices
of Oxford Methodism may easily be gathered from the present
chapter. Nothing has been omitted, nothing exaggerated,
and nothing altered. The system was cradled in a storm, and
more than once, even at Oxford, was in danger of perishing.
At least twice, during Wesley’s absence, it was all but
wrecked; and, from names casually mentioned, we incline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
to think its permanently established converts were much less
numerous than its timid, time serving backsliders. At all
events, but for the ministry of the two Wesleys, of Whitefield,
Ingham, Hervey, and Gambold, the memory of Oxford
Methodism might, without public loss, have been buried in
oblivion. As it is, no English historian can ignore it. In its
results it is one of the greatest facts in church annals. At
Oxford, it was far from perfect. It was misty, austere, gloomy,
and forbidding; but it was intensely sincere, earnest, and
self denying. Its principles and its aims may substantially
be summed up in the words of Wesley himself, written forty
years afterwards:—</p>

<p>“Two young men, without a name, without friends, without
either power or fortune, set out from college with principles
totally different from those of the common people, to oppose
all the world, learned and unlearned; and to combat popular
prejudices of every kind. Their first principle directly attacked
all the wickedness; their second, all the bigotry in the world.
Thus they attempted a reformation, not of opinions (feathers,
trifles not worth naming), but of men’s tempers and lives; of
vice in every kind; of everything contrary to justice, mercy,
or truth. And for this it was, that they carried their lives in
their hands; and that both the great vulgar and the small
looked upon them as mad dogs, and treated them as such.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after that event, the chief of the Oxford
Methodists were widely scattered: Gambold was a clergyman
at Stanton-Harcourt; Ingham became a curate in Essex;
Whitefield, though not ordained, went on an evangelistic tour
to Gloucester, Bristol, and other places;<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Broughton was
chaplain at the Tower; and the two Wesleys repaired to the
metropolis, where they were the guests of James Hutton, or
rather of James Hutton’s father, in Westminster.</p>

<p>Mr. Hutton was now in the twentieth year of his age.
At Oxford he had met with the Wesley brothers, and had
invited them to visit him. His father was an ordained clergyman
of the Church of England; but, not being able to take
the oaths at the accession of George I., he had resigned
his Church preferments, and now kept a boarding school in
a house next door to that of Wesley’s brother Samuel. Here,
on Sunday evenings, the venerable man held meetings, at
which he read, and prayed, and sung with penitents; and
here Wesley preached a sermon on “One thing is needful,”
which was the means of converting both James Hutton and
his sister.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Just at this juncture, Dr. John Burton, of Corpus Christi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
College, Oxford, was evincing great interest in the colonisation
of Georgia. Three years before, he had preached and
published a sermon, with an appendix on the state of the
Georgian settlement. He now met with Wesley in London,
and introduced him to Oglethorpe, who strongly urged the
high church Methodist to undertake a mission to the infant
colony. Wesley took counsel with his brother Samuel; asked
the advice of William Law; and went to Manchester to consult
his friends Clayton and Byrom. Thence he proceeded to
Epworth, and laid the proposal before his widowed mother,
who replied: “Had I twenty sons, I should rejoice if they
were all so employed.”</p>

<p>On September 8 Dr. Burton wrote to him pressing him
to consent to go. The doctor told him that “plausible and
popular doctors of divinity were not the men wanted for
Georgia; for the ease, luxury, and levity in which they were
accustomed to indulge disqualified them for such a work.”
He and the Georgian trustees wished for men who were “inured
to contempt of the ornaments and conveniences of life,
to bodily austerities, and to serious thoughts;” and such he
considered Wesley.</p>

<p>Ten days after the date of this letter Wesley accepted
the proposal, and Burton expressed his pleasure, and added,
“You have too much steadiness of mind to be disturbed by
the light scoffs of the idle and profane.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> In another long
letter (hitherto unpublished), dated Eton College, September
28, 1735, Dr. Burton, after reminding Wesley that he will
have a fine opportunity for usefulness during the voyage to
Georgia, proceeds to recommend him, on his arrival, to visit
from house to house, and preach everywhere. He tells him
that “some of the colonists are ignorant, and most of them
are disposed to licentiousness.” He adds: “You will find
abundant room for the exercise of patience and prudence, as
well as piety. One end for which we were associated was
the conversion of negro slaves. As yet, nothing has been
attempted in this way; but a door is opened. The Purisburghers
have purchased slaves; they act under our influence;
and Mr. Oglethorpe will think it advisable to begin there. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
see the harvest truly is great. With regard to your behaviour
and manner of address, you will keep in mind the pattern of
St. Paul, who became ‘all things to all men that he might
gain some.’ In every case, distinguish between what is
essential and what is merely circumstantial to Christianity;
between what is indispensable and what is variable; between
what is of Divine and what is of human authority. I mention
this, because men are apt to deceive themselves in such cases;
and we see the traditions and ordinances of men frequently
insisted on with more vigour than the commandments of God
to which they are subordinate.”</p>

<p>This was good advice, and, in Wesley’s case, not unneeded.
Sixteen days after the date of Dr. Burton’s letter, Wesley
embarked, taking with him five hundred and fifty copies of a
treatise on the Lord’s Supper, besides other books,—“the
gift of several Christian friends for the use of the settlers in
Georgia.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>James Edward Oglethorpe was the third son of Sir Theophilus
Oglethorpe, of Godalming, Surrey. At a suitable age
he entered the army, and became secretary and aide-de-camp
to Prince Eugene. In 1722 he succeeded to his father’s
estate, and obtained a seat in parliament, which he retained
nearly thirty years. From the first, he showed himself to be
a steady and faithful friend of humanity. These were days of
harsh government. The gallows was the penalty for petty
thefts; and each year, at least four thousand unhappy men
in Great Britain were immured in prison for the misfortune of
being poor. A small debt was quite enough to expose a
struggling man to a perpetuity of imprisonment; and an indiscreet
bargain doomed many a well-meaning, miserable dupe
to lifelong confinement. Oglethorpe obtained a parliamentary
committee, to inquire into the state of prisons; the result of
which was that a large number of debtors were released from
confinement, and restored to light and to liberty. Being released,
it was a serious question what to do with them.</p>

<p>It so happened that, though the whole of the eastern seaboard
of America seemed to be already parcelled out among
companies and colonists, there was still remaining a com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>paratively
small strip of country, intervening between South
Carolina and Florida, and situated between the river Alatamaha
on the south and the river Savannah on the north, and
having a sea-coast stretching a distance of sixty or seventy
miles. This strip of land was a wilderness over which
England held only a nominal jurisdiction; but it occurred to
Oglethorpe and his friends to plant in this sunny clime those
children of misfortune whom they had released from prison,
but who were still without food and shelter. Accordingly, on
the 9th of June, 1732, a charter was obtained from George II.,
erecting this thin slice of America into the province of Georgia,
and appointing Oglethorpe and twenty other gentlemen (of
whom Dr. Burton was one) trustees to hold the same for a
period of one and twenty years, “in trust for the poor.” The
benevolence of England was aroused. The trustees set an
example of princely liberality by their private subscriptions;
the Bank of England presented a donation of £10,000; an
equal amount was voted by the House of Commons; and the
total sum raised, with but little effort, and almost without
solicitation, was £36,000. Within five months after the signing
of the charter, the first company of emigrants, one hundred
and twenty in number, set sail, with Oglethorpe as their commander,
and the Rev. Henry Herbert, a clergyman of the
Established Church, as their minister. At the commencement
of the month of February, 1733, the colonists reached the high
bluff on which Savannah is now erected, and encamped near
the edge of the river. The streets of the intended town were
laid out with the greatest regularity; and the houses were to
be constructed on one model,—each a frame of sawn timber,
measuring sixteen feet by twenty-four, its sides to be enclosed
with unplaned boards, and its floor to be of rough deals, and
its roof of shingle. Each freeholder was allotted fifty acres
of ground, five of which were near Savannah, and the remaining
forty-five farther off. Thus began the commonwealth of
Georgia. The humane reformer of prison life was already
the father of a state. A large number of Indians met him to
make an alliance with his colony; the meeting was friendly;
to each chief he gave a laced coat, a hat, and a shirt; and
to their attendants gunpowder, bullets, linen, tobacco, pipes,
tape, and eight kegs of rum, to carry home as presents to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
their respective towns. In a letter, dated June 9, 1733,
Oglethorpe states that a door was opened for the conversion
of the Indians; and nothing seemed to be wanting but a
minister who understood their language: in action and expression,
they were masters of eloquence, and many of their
speeches were equal to those which scholars most admire in
the Greek and Roman writings.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The next company of emigrants belonged to a different
class. About a year before the charter for the Georgian
colony was granted, a remarkable revival of religion took
place at Saltzburg, in Germany. By merely reading the
Bible, above twenty thousand people were led to renounce
Popery and to embrace the Reformed religion. The popish
priests complained to the Archbishop of Saltzburg that these
Protestant converts assembled in various places, and sang
hymns and offered prayers. The archbishop published an
edict prohibiting such assemblies, upon pain of fines, corporal
punishments, and even death itself. The new converts, however,
still assembled as before; and now his serene highness
the archbishop let loose his partisans, and commenced a murderous
persecution, which drove thousands of innocent, unoffending,
godly people into exile. Numbers were dragged
to prison; some were led about with ropes round their necks;
others had their hands so tightly tied with cords behind their
backs that the blood spurted from their finger ends. The
archbishop’s soldiers struck some of them in the face with
their fists, calling them “heretic dogs and hell-hounds.” One
poor fellow was fined seventy florins for singing a Protestant
psalm of praise. Protestant preachers were called “murderers,
buffle-heads, and children of the devil;” and the Protestant
doctrine was stigmatised as “faith for swine and
stinking goats.” Every one who embraced Luther’s doctrines
“would be roasted in hell;” and the moment any one read
his books the reader “became an offering to the devil.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>What was the result? The Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Foreign Parts heard of these poor persecuted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Protestants, and proposed to them to emigrate to Georgia.
Thousands of them had fled from Saltzburg; and others were
still in prison there, fed with bread and water, and employing
themselves in praying and singing psalms. Large numbers
were taken into service by Protestants at Augsburg and other
places; and one section of the fugitives embraced the proposal
just mentioned, and on October 31, 1733, set out for Georgia.
After a discourse, prayer, and benedictions, and well supplied
with Bibles, hymns, catechisms, and books of devotion, they
began their pilgrimage, one wagon conveying all the chattels
that they had, and two others their feebler companions and their
little ones. We need not stop to tell the charities that cheered
them on their journey,—how they entered Frankfort, two by
two, in solemn procession, singing sacred songs,—and how
they were joined at Rotterdam by the preachers Bolzius and
Gronau, both disciplined in piety at the Orphan House of
Professor Francke. Six days brought them to Dover, where
several of the Georgian trustees met them and provided for
their wants; and on January 8, 1734, they set sail, singing
the “Te Deum” and praising God with both lips and
hearts.</p>

<p>The Saltzburghers arrived in Georgia in the month of March,
met with Oglethorpe, and chose a settlement twenty-one miles
from Savannah, where there were “rivers, little hills, clear
brooks, cool springs, a fertile soil, and plenty of grass.” At
Charlestown, where they first landed, they ascertained that in
the province of Carolina there were thirty thousand negroes, all
of them slaves, working six days in the week for their owners
without pay, and allowed to work on the Sundays for themselves.
Near Savannah, they found a beautiful garden of ten
acres, already planted with thriving orange-trees, olives, mulberries,
figs, peaches, cabbages, peas, and pulse. The spot
which they had chosen as their settlement, and to which they
gave the name of Ebenezer, was surrounded by vast forests
of cedars, walnuts, cypresses, and oaks, with wild vines running
to the top of the highest trees. As to game, there
were eagles, turkeys, roebucks, goats, deer, wild cows, horses,
hares, partridges, and buffaloes without number. The Saltzburghers
built tents made of the bark of trees, constructed
roads and bridges, set up religious services, were furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
with domestic utensils and with cattle, and were soon a prosperous
community.</p>

<p>In April Oglethorpe returned to England, bringing with
him Tomo-chichi and other Indians, to invigorate the confidence
of England in the destiny of Georgia. Parliament
continued its benefactions, the king expressed interest in a
province which bore his name, and the youngest child of
England’s colonial enterprise won universal favour.</p>

<p>The next company of emigrants were a number of Scotch
Highlanders, who founded New Inverness, in Darien; the next
a number of Moravians, of whom more anon; and the next after
that, the company with whom Wesley sailed. Wesley’s predecessor
in Georgia was the Rev. Samuel Quincy,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> a native of
Massachusetts, but educated in England. Mr. Quincy wishing
to return to England, the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts sent Wesley as his successor, at a
salary of £50 a year.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The chief object in founding the colony
was to grow flax and hemp, to breed silkworms, and to raise
raw silk.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The common seal of the corporation had on one
side a group of silkworms at their toils, with the motto, <i>Non
sibi, sed aliis</i>; and on the other, two figures reposing on urns,
emblematic of the boundary rivers; and between them the
genius of “Georgia Augusta,” with the cap of liberty on her
head, a spear in one hand, and the horn of plenty in the other.
It must be added that in this young community ardent spirits
were prohibited, and the introduction of slavery forbidden.</p>

<p>The Transatlantic colonies existing in 1735 were nothing
more than a mere fringe skirting the eastern coast of that vast
continent. The Spaniards were in Florida; the English in
Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
New England; and the French in Canada. This was all.
Excepting these few feeble colonial settlements, the whole of
the immense American continent—which, measuring from
New York to California, and from Lake Superior to New
Orleans, extends in one direction 3300 miles and in the other
1300 miles—was one vast, rich, but uncultivated wilderness, the
home of myriads of birds and beasts, and sparsely inhabited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
by savage Indians. Bancroft enumerates above forty Indian
tribes, or nations, embracing about 180,000 souls, whose wigwams
and hunting grounds were all situated on the eastern
side of the Mississippi. The men were warriors, and the
women labourers. Their education was acquired solely in
the school of nature, and their chief almanac was the flight
of birds, announcing the progress of the seasons. They
kept no herds, and were never shepherds, but depended for
their food on the chase, the fisheries, and a little farming.
Their scanty clothing was made of skins, and their feet protected
by soft mocassins. Their principal ornaments were
strings of shells, the fairest feathers of the turkey, the skin
of the rattlesnake, and an enemy’s scalp. Their skins were
oft tattooed; and, when making visits, they painted themselves
gloriously, delighting especially in vermilion. They
worshipped an unseen power pervading everything, which
they called the Great Spirit, and had their sorcerers, medicine
men, and prophets. Faith in the spirit world, as revealed by
dreams, was universal; and festivals in honour of the dead
were frequent.</p>

<p>What became of these Indians? and where are their descendants?
To answer these questions would be to pass
through scenes of horror without a parallel, and to write a
history of blood.</p>

<p>Such was America in 1735. What is it now, and what is
likely to be its future? Who could have imagined that, in
one hundred and thirty years, this huge wilderness would be
transformed into one of the greatest nations upon earth; and
that the Methodism, begun at Savannah, would pervade the
continent, and, ecclesiastically considered, become the mightiest
power existing? But we must now return to Wesley and
his Georgian mission.</p>

<p>In a letter, dated October 10, 1735, Wesley gives his
reasons for going to Georgia. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My chief motive is the hope of saving my own soul. I hope to learn
the true sense of the gospel of Christ by preaching it to the heathen.
They have no comments to construe away the text; no vain philosophy
to corrupt it; no luxurious, sensual, covetous, ambitious expounders to
soften its unpleasing truths. They have no party, no interest to serve,
and are therefore fit to receive the gospel in its simplicity. They are as
little children, humble, willing to learn, and eager to do, the will of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“A right faith will, I trust, by the mercy of God, open the way for a
right practice; especially when most of those temptations are removed
which here so easily beset me. It will be no small thing to be able, without
fear of giving offence, to live on water and the fruits of the earth.
An Indian hut affords no food for curiosity, no gratification of the desire
of grand, or new, or pretty things. The pomp and show of the world
have no place in the wilds of America.</p>

<p>“Further: I hope from the moment I leave the English shore, under
the acknowledged character of a teacher sent from God, there shall be no
word heard from my lips but what properly flows from that character;
and the same faithfulness I hope to show in dispensing my Master’s
goods, if it please Him to send me to those who, like His first followers,
have all things common. What a guard is here against that root of evil,
the love of money, and all the vile attractions that spring from it!</p>

<p>“I then hope to know what it is to love my neighbour as myself, and
to feel the powers of that second motive to visit the heathens, even the
desire to impart to them what I have received,—a saving knowledge of
the gospel of Christ. I have been a grievous sinner from my youth up,
and am yet laden with foolish and hurtful desires; but I am assured, if I
be once converted myself, God will then employ me both to strengthen
my brethren, and to preach His name to the gentiles.</p>

<p>“I cannot hope to attain the same degree of holiness here, which I
may there. I shall lose nothing I desire to keep. I shall still have food
to eat, and raiment to put on; and, if any man have a desire of other
things, let him know that the greatest blessing that can possibly befall
him is, to be cut off from all occasions of gratifying those desires which,
unless speedily rooted out, will drown his soul in everlasting perdition.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Exception may fairly be taken to some of the sentiments
contained in this letter. The Indians were not the docile
children that Wesley imagined; nor is it true that life in
heathendom is more favourable to the attainment of holiness
than life in Christendom: but we neither have space nor wish
to criticise Wesley’s views, our chief object being to represent
him as he represents himself.</p>

<p>Wesley went on board the <i>Simmonds</i>, off Gravesend, on
October 14, 1735; and, the day following, he wrote a characteristic
letter, (probably his last before leaving the English
waters,) to his brother Samuel, who was now head master of
the school at Tiverton. After telling him that, two days
before, he had presented to the queen his father’s “Dissertations
on the Book of Job,” and had received “many good
words and smiles,” he continues:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Elegance of style is not to be weighed against purity of heart; therefore,
whatever has any tendency to impair that purity is not to be
tolerated, much less recommended, for the sake of that elegance. But of
this sort are most of the classics usually read in great schools: many of
them tending to inflame the lusts of the flesh, and more to feed the lust
of the eye and the pride of life. I beseech you therefore, by the mercies
of God, who would have us holy as He is holy, that you banish all such
poison from your school; and that you introduce, in their place, such
Christian authors as will work together with you in building up your
flock in the knowledge and love of God. For assure yourself, dear
brother, you are even now called to the converting of heathens as well as
I. So many souls are committed to your charge by God, to be prepared
for a happy eternity. You are to instruct them, not only in the beggarly
elements of Greek and Latin; but much more, in the gospel. You are to
labour with all your might to convince them, that Christianity is not a
negation, or an external thing, but a new heart, a mind conformed to
that of Christ, ‘faith working by love,’”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Two days after writing the above, Wesley, in order to
converse with his German fellow-passengers, began to study
that language; and three days later, believing that self-denial
might be helpful to his piety, he wholly left off the use
of flesh and wine, and confined himself to a vegetable diet,
chiefly rice and biscuit. This he continued during the whole
of his residence in Georgia; but on his return to England, for
the sake of some who thought he made it a point of conscience,
he resumed his former mode of living, and practised
it to the end of life, except during a two years’ interim, when
he again became vegetarian and teetotaler, because Dr.
Cheyne assured him that this was the only way to “be free
from fevers.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Wesley is on board—who are the chief of his fellow
voyagers? His brother Charles, Benjamin Ingham, James
Edward Oglethorpe, Charles Delamotte, and David Nitschmann.
Two others had intended going, namely, Westley
Hall and Matthew Salmon; and both had been recently
ordained with reference to the Georgian mission. At the last
moment, however, Salmon’s friends pounced upon him, and sent
him, almost forcibly, to his parental home in Cheshire; while
Hall, who had actually hired a coach to carry him and his
wife (Wesley’s sister) to Gravesend, where the ship was lying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
received, as he was about to start, the intelligence that his
family were not only opposed to his embarking, but had procured
him a Church benefice. This so changed his missionary
views and feelings, that he instantly countermanded the order
for the coach, put aside all his luggage and preparations for
the mission, and, hastening to General Oglethorpe, told him
he had resolved not to go.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Of Charles Wesley nothing need be said; his fame is
everywhere. Benjamin Ingham was a young Yorkshireman,
twenty-three years of age, and, for the last three months,
had been preaching in the villages surrounding the metropolis
with singular success. “Fast, and pray,” wrote Wesley at
the beginning of September: “fast and pray; and then send
me word whether you dare go with me to the Indians.”
Ingham at first thought there were heathens enough at home;
but, a fortnight after, he acceded to Wesley’s proposal; and,
with as pure and devoted a heart as ever throbbed in
missionary’s bosom, away he went to convert the Indians in
America.</p>

<p>Oglethorpe has been already mentioned. Suffice it to add,
that though chivalrous in the highest degree, and the very soul
of benevolence and honour,—though brave and loyal, and full
of enthusiastic feeling,—he was irascible and sometimes rash,
talkative, tinged with vanity, and somewhat boastful. Like
many other public men, he became the victim of unmerited
censure and injudicious praise. The last thirty years of his life
were chiefly spent in the society of literary and learned men.
He died in 1785; and Hannah More, in a letter dated a year
before his death, spoke of him thus: “He is much above
ninety years old, and the finest figure you ever saw. He perfectly
realises all my ideas of Nestor. His literature is great,
his knowledge of the world extensive, and his faculties as
bright as ever. He is quite a <i>preux chevalier</i>, heroic, romantic,
and full of the old gallantry.”</p>

<p>Charles Delamotte was a young man of twenty-one, the son
of a Middlesex magistrate; and was so attached to Wesley,
that when he heard he was about to embark for Georgia he
determined to go with him, and to act as his servant. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
father, naturally enough, strongly objected, and offered to
settle him in a handsome business; but the youth was obstinate,
and after obtaining a partial consent from his parents and
family, set sail with Wesley, lived with him, served under him
as a son in the gospel, did much good, and endured great hardships
for the sake of Christ. On his return to England, he
became a Moravian, settled at Barrow-upon-Humber, where
he spent a long life of piety and peace, and died in 1796.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>David Nitschmann was born in Moravia, and was now in
the sixtieth year of his age. In 1720 a remarkable revival of
religion took place in the town where David lived; but, by
the intervention of the Jesuits, the meetings of the new converts
were prohibited, and many who attended them were
imprisoned in stables, cellars, and other offensive places. A
police officer entered Nitschmann’s house, where one hundred
and fifty of these godly people were assembled, and seized
all the books within his reach. The congregation at once
struck up a stanza of one of Luther’s hymns:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If the whole world with devils swarmed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That threatened us to swallow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We will not fear, for we are armed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And victory will follow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twenty persons, including David, all heads of respectable
families, were arrested and sent to gaol. For three
days David was deprived of food, and was so cruelly ironed
that the blood spurted from his nose and mouth, and oozed
from his very pores. After some time, he escaped from his
horrid dungeon, and fled for safety to his Moravian friends at
Herrnhut. David was now a Moravian bishop, and, accompanied
by about thirty Moravians, was on his way to visit the
congregations of the Brethren in Georgia.</p>

<p>Such were the chief of Wesley’s fellow voyagers. As already
stated, they embarked at Gravesend on October 14,
1735; but it was not until December 10 that they fairly
started.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> First of all, they encountered a storm in the Downs;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
then, on arriving at Cowes, they had to await the man-of-war
that was to be their convoy.</p>

<p>The rules which Wesley and his friends observed during
their long voyage were as follows:—From four in the morning
till five, they employed in private prayer. From five to seven,
they read the Bible together, carefully comparing what they
read with the writings of the earliest ages. At seven, they
breakfasted. At eight, they had public prayers and expounded
the lesson. From nine to twelve, Wesley usually learned
German, Delamotte studied Greek and navigation, Charles
Wesley wrote sermons, and Ingham gave instruction to the
twelve children on board. At twelve, they met together for
mutual prayer, and to report progress. About one, they
dined; and from the time of dinner till four in the afternoon,
they read or spoke to certain of the passengers of whom they
had respectively taken charge. At four, they had evening
prayers, and either expounded the lesson, or catechized and
instructed the children in the presence of the congregation.
From five to six was again spent in private prayer. From
six to seven they read, each in his own cabin, to three different
detachments of the English passengers, of whom about eighty
were on board. At seven, Wesley joined the Moravians in
their public service; while Ingham read, between the decks,
to as many as desired to hear. At eight, the four faithful
friends met in private to exhort and instruct each other; and,
between nine and ten, they went to bed without mats and
blankets, where neither the roaring of the sea nor the rocking
of the ship could rob them of refreshing rest.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>While detained at Cowes, Wesley, after careful instruction,
baptized four unbaptized Quakers.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Charles Wesley, being
known to the minister of the town, preached several times in
the parish church to large congregations; and, in the house of
a poor woman, read to the crowds which flocked to hear him.
In other respects also their detention was productive of good;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
for a gentleman who scoffed at religion left the ship; the
second mate, who was an insolent and ill natured fellow, was
expelled; and a young man was received on board, who, for
his piety, had been turned adrift by his rich parents, and had
been praying incessantly that he might be directed to a place
where he could have the advantage of public prayers and the
holy sacrament.</p>

<p>On November 3, while walking in the Isle of Wight, the
four friends agreed upon the following resolutions, which they

<p>Of the Moravians on board, Ingham, in a long letter to his
mother, wrote as follows:—“They are a good, devout, peaceable,
and heavenly-minded people; and almost the only
time you know they are in the ship is when they are harmoniously
singing the praises of the great Creator, which
they constantly do twice a day. Their example was very
edifying. They are more like the primitive Christians than
any church now existing, for they retain both the faith, practice,
and discipline delivered by the apostles. They have
regularly ordained bishops, priests, and deacons. Baptisms,
confirmation, and the eucharist are duly administered. Discipline
is strictly exercised, without respect of persons. They
all submit themselves to their pastors in everything. They
live together in perfect love and peace, having for the present
all things common. They are more ready to serve their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
neighbours than themselves. In business they are diligent,
in all their dealings strictly just; and in everything they
behave themselves with meekness, sweetness, and humility.”</p>

<p>From the same letter we learn that, on October 18,
Wesley and Ingham began to read the Old Testament together;
and, at the rate of between nine and ten chapters daily,
finished it before they arrived at Georgia. On the day
following, Wesley commenced preaching without notes; and
during the passage, in a series of sermons, he went through
the whole of our Saviour’s sermon on the mount, and, every
sabbath, had a weekly sacrament.</p>

<p>The voyage, from Cowes to the Savannah river, was made
in fifty-seven days. Oglethorpe seems to have acted with
great kindness. On one occasion, when some of the officers
and gentlemen on board took liberties with Wesley and his
friends, Oglethorpe indignantly exclaimed, “What mean you,
sirs? Do you take these gentlemen for tithe-pig parsons?
They are gentlemen of learning and respectability. They
are my friends, and whoever offers an affront to them insults
me.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> This was quite enough, and, ever after, the poor
Methodists were treated with respect. Oglethorpe was irritable,
but noble-hearted and generous. Wesley, hearing an
unusual noise in the general’s cabin, entered to inquire the
cause; on which the angry soldier cried: “Excuse me, Mr.
Wesley; I have met with a provocation too great to bear.
This villain, Grimaldi, an Italian servant, has drunk nearly
the whole of my Cyprus wine, the only wine that agrees with
me, and several dozens of which I had provided for myself.
But I am determined to be revenged. The rascal shall be
tied hand and foot, and be carried to the man-of-war; for I
never forgive.” “Then,” said Wesley with great calmness,
“then I hope, sir, you never sin.” Oglethorpe was confounded,
his vengeance was gone, he put his hand into his pocket,
pulled out a bunch of keys, and threw them at Grimaldi,
saying, “There, villain! take my keys, and behave better for
the future.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The voyage to Georgia was not without danger. On the
17th of January, the sea broke over the ship, and, shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
it from stem to stern, brought down the mainyard upon
the decks, and dashed through the cabin windows. Six
days after, an immense wave vaulted over Wesley’s head,
and drenched him to the skin. Two days later, the winds
roared, and the ship rocked to and fro with the utmost
violence. The sea sparkled and smoked as if on fire, and
the air literally blazed with lightning. The mainsail was
torn to tatters, and the companion swept away.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Just at
the time this occurred, the Moravians were engaged in their
evening service, and were singing a psalm of praise. As usual,
Wesley was with them. The English passengers began screaming;
but the Germans calmly continued singing. Wesley was
struck with this, and asked one of them, after the service was
concluded, “Were you not afraid?” He answered, “I thank
God, no.” Wesley asked again, “But were not your women
and children afraid?” “No,” replied the Moravian, “our
women and children are not afraid to die.” From the
Moravians Wesley went among the terror-struck English, and
pointed out the difference between him that feareth God and
him that feareth Him not; and then concludes his account of
the storm by saying, “This was the most glorious day which
I had ever seen.” Eleven days after, on February 5, 1736,
they safely cast anchor in the Savannah river, and were welcomed
by the firing of cannon, and by all the freeholders, constables,
and tithingmen, presenting arms; while Oglethorpe’s
first act was to give orders to provide materials to build a
church.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Savannah was now a town of about forty houses,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> standing
on a flat bluff, rising forty or fifty feet above the crescent
river flowing at its base. On the eastern side of the town
was a swamp, on the west a wood, and on the south a forest of
pines, fourteen miles in length. The principal buildings were a
courthouse, which served also for a church, a log-built prison, a
storehouse, a public mill for grinding corn, and a residence
for the trustees’ steward. All the houses were of the same
size. There were still standing the four beautiful pines, under
which Oglethorpe encamped when he landed with the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
settlers, and which for nearly a twelvemonth he used as a
sleeping place. At the distance of about half a mile was a
small Indian town, in which large numbers of the Creek nation
were occasionally accustomed to assemble. The climate was
exceedingly salubrious, the land rich, and the water good.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
Every male emigrant was allowed a watch coat, a musket, a
bayonet, a hatchet, a hammer, a hand saw, a shovel, a hoe, a
gimlet, a knife, an iron pot, a pair of pothooks, and a frying-pan:
also for his maintenance, during the first year, 312 lbs.
of beef or pork, 104 of rice, 104 of Indian corn or peas, 104
of meal, one pint of strong beer per day, 52 quarts of
molasses, 16 lbs. of cheese, 12 of butter, eight oz. of
spice, 12 lbs. of sugar, four gallons of vinegar, 24 lbs. of salt,
12 quarts of lamp oil, one lb. of cotton thread, and 12 lbs of
soap. Proportionate allowances were made to women and
children.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Such facts will help the reader to imagine the kind
of home and society which Wesley had in Georgia.</p>

<p>The only other towns in Georgia, even when Wesley came
back to England, were Frederica, in St. Simon’s Island, one
hundred miles south of Savannah; Darien, the settlement of the
Scotch Highlanders, at a distance of about eighty miles; New
Ebenezer, consisting of sixty huts, nineteen miles; Highgate
and Hampstead, with fourteen families, four or five miles southwest,
and Thunderbolt, with three families, six miles southeast.
Such were the English settlements in Georgia. All the
rest of that large territory was woods, swamps, and prairies,
the home of savage Indians, and of savage beasts. The
Georgian Indians had no literature, no religion, and no civil
government. Every one did what was right in his own eyes;
and, if his neighbour felt aggrieved, he would warily do his
best to shoot him, scalp him, or cut off his ears. All of them,
except perhaps the Choctaws, were gluttons, drunkards,
thieves, and liars; implacable, unmerciful, murderers of
fathers, murderers of mothers, murderers of their own children.
Husbands, strictly speaking, the women had none, for the men
left their so called wives at pleasure; and the wives, in return
for such desertion, would cut the throats of all the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
they had had by their faithless swains. The Choctaws possessed
a large extent of land, eight or nine hundred miles
west of Savannah, had many well inhabited towns, and six
thousand warriors. The Chicasaws, dwelling among meadows,
springs, and rivers, six or seven hundred miles in the interior,
had ten towns, and about nine hundred fighting men,—all of
them eating, drinking, and smoking almost day and night,
extremely indolent except in war, and torturing and burning
their prisoners with the most fiendish cruelty. The Cherokees
lived in a mountainous, fruitful, and pleasant country, three or
four hundred miles from Savannah, had fifty-two towns, and
above three thousand men of war. The Uchees had only one
small town, near two hundred miles distant from the Savannah
settlement, and were hated by most and despised by all the
other Indian tribes, for their cowardice and superlative diligence
in thieving. The Creeks were located at a distance of
about four hundred miles, had a well watered country, and
fifteen hundred fighting men, and, of all the Indians, were the
most infected with the insatiate love of drink, as well as other
European vices. In such a country John Wesley lived, from
February 5, 1736, to December 2, 1737.</p>

<p>One of the first to meet Wesley on the shores of Georgia
was the well known Moravian elder, August Gottlieb Spangenberg.
Wesley asked his advice how to act in his new
sphere of labour. Spangenberg replied, “My brother, I must
first ask you one or two questions. Have you the witness
within yourself? Does the Spirit of God bear witness with
your spirit, that you are a child of God?” Wesley was surprised
at such questions. They were new to him. He was at
a loss how to answer. Spangenberg continued, “Do you know
Jesus Christ?” This was easier, and Wesley answered, “I
know He is the Saviour of the world.” “True,” said Spangenberg;
“but do you know He has saved <i>you</i>?” Wesley
was again perplexed, but answered, “I hope He has died to
save me.” Spangenberg only added, “Do you know yourself?”
Wesley replied, “I do.” An odd conversation, leaving
Spangenberg in doubt respecting the real conversion of
the Oxford priest, and leading Wesley to think of doctrines
which took him more than the next two years to understand.</p>

<p>Nine days after his arrival, Wesley and his friends were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
visited by Tomo-Chichi (whom Oglethorpe had brought to
England some time before) and half-a-dozen other Indians.
Informed of their arrival, the young clergymen met them
in their gowns and cassocks. The chief bid them welcome,
said he would assemble the great men of his nation, and
expressed a wish that they would teach his children; while
his wife gave them a jar of milk, as emblematic of her
wish that they might feed the Indians with milk, for they
were but children, and a jar of honey, with the hope that the
missionaries would be sweet to them.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Ingham and Charles Wesley went off with Oglethorpe to
lay out the town of Frederica; and Wesley and Delamotte,
having no house of their own to live in, lodged, during the first
month, with Spangenberg, Nitschmann, and other Moravian
friends. Thus, from morning to night, were they mixed up
with these godly people, and had ample opportunity to observe
their spirit and behaviour. Wesley writes: “They were always
employed, always cheerful themselves, and in good humour
with one another; they had put away all anger, and strife, and
wrath, and bitterness, and clamour, and evil speaking; they
walked worthy of the vocation wherewith they were called,
and adorned the gospel of our Lord in all things.” Wesley
was present at the election and ordination of Anton Seifart<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
as a bishop for Georgia, the simplicity and solemnity of the
service making him almost forget the seventeen hundred years
between, and imagine himself in one of those assemblies where
form and state were not, but Paul the tentmaker or Peter
the fisherman presided, with the demonstration of the Spirit
and of power. Who can estimate the influence of such intercourse
in moulding the subsequent character and life of this
inquiring missionary?</p>

<p>Mr. Quincy, Wesley’s predecessor, having now removed to
Carolina, Wesley took possession of the wood-built rectory,
and, on March 7th, commenced his ministry at Savannah
by preaching a sermon from 1 Corinthians xiii. 3, in which
he introduced two death-bed scenes,—that of his father at
Epworth, and another which he had witnessed at Savannah,
and which was “a spectacle worthy to be seen of God and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
angels and men.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> He officiated at nine in the morning, at
twelve, and again in the afternoon;<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and announced his design
to administer the sacrament on every Sunday and on every
holiday.</p>

<p>A few days subsequent to this, writing to his mother, he
remarked:—“We are likely to stay here some months. The
place is pleasant beyond imagination, and exceeding healthful.
I have not had a moment’s illness of any kind since I
set my foot upon the continent; nor do I know any more than
one of my seven hundred parishioners who is sick at this time.
Many of them indeed are, I believe, very angry already; for
a gentleman, no longer ago than last night (March 17), made
a ball; but the public prayers happening to begin about the
same time, the church was full, and the ballroom so empty
that the entertainment could not go forward. I should be
heartily glad if any poor and religious men or women of
Epworth or Wroote would come over to me. General Oglethorpe
would give them land enough, and provisions gratis,
till they could live on the produce of it.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Wesley, in this letter, evidently considers the whole of the
Georgian settlements as his parish; for, so far from Savannah
having at this time a population of seven hundred souls, there
was scarcely that number in the whole of the settlements put
together. Georgia was his parish; for, Mr. Quincy being gone,
he was the only minister of the Church of England inducted
into ministerial work in the Georgian territory. Charles
Wesley was Oglethorpe’s secretary; and though Benjamin
Ingham had gone with a few colonists to where Frederica was
to stand, Frederica itself as yet did not exist. Besides, Ingham’s
visit was intended to be but temporary, his mind being
fully fixed upon a mission to the Indians. Indeed, this was
Wesley’s purpose also. Their only object in quitting England
was, not to preach to the colonists, but to the Indians; and
the reason why Wesley had begun to preach to the English
at Savannah was because Mr. Quincy, the minister of the
English, had left the colony, and they were now as sheep
without a shepherd; and also because, through the French on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the one hand and the Spaniards on the other, the Indians
were at present in great confusion, and had become so excited
by French and Spanish plots and treachery that it was not
only dangerous to go among them, but, as Tomo-Chichi told
Wesley and his friends at the interview already mentioned,
they seemed determined not to hear “the great word”
which the white man had to teach.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In these two facts we
find the reason, and the only reason, why Wesley’s object in
going to Georgia was not fulfilled; and why, instead of
preaching to the Indians in the woods, he spent his time in
preaching to the English at Savannah.</p>

<p>The commencement of Wesley’s ministry was auspicious.
A fortnight after preaching his first sermon, he wrote to his
brother Charles as follows: “I have hitherto no opposition at
all; all is smooth, and fair, and promising. Many seem to
be awakened; all are full of respect and commendation. We
cannot see any cloud gathering. But this calm cannot last:
storms must come hither, too; and let them come, when we
are ready to meet them.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Wesley had lived so long in the tempest of opposition that
it is no wonder he felt it strange to find himself in the midst
of an unbroken calm, surrounded by nothing but “respect and
commendation.” This was a new experience, but it was soon
ended.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley and Ingham were already in hot water at
Frederica, and the latter hurried off to Savannah for advice.
It was only three weeks since Wesley had there commenced
his ministry; yet he had already established daily morning
and evening public prayers, and a weekly communion; he had
also formed a society, which met on Wednesday, Friday, and
Sunday nights, to read and pray and sing psalms together;
and Delamotte had begun to teach a few orphan children.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
This was a vigorous beginning, but now Wesley and Delamotte
had to hasten to Frederica, leaving Ingham to supply
their place in the best way he could.</p>

<p>Charles had been baptizing children by trine immersion, and
endeavouring to reconcile scolding women. Some of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
termagants had prejudiced Oglethorpe against him, and
the poor secretary was now treated with coldness, and even
charged with mutiny. A woman, whose husband had been
put into confinement, blamed him for being the cause of it,
and threatened to be revenged upon him, by “exposing his
d—— d hypocrisy and his prayers four times a day by beat
of drum.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> While all the others were provided with boards
to sleep upon, he was left to sleep upon the ground. His
few well-wishers became afraid to speak to him, and even his
washerwoman refused in future to wash his linen.</p>

<p>Wesley and Delamotte left Savannah on April 4, and returned
on April 20; having spent ten days on the voyage,
and six in settling the miserable squabbles that had sprung up
among the palmetto huts of Frederica.</p>

<p>On the day of his arrival, Wesley wrote to Oglethorpe as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <i>April 20, 1736</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Savannah</span> never was so dear to me as now. I found so little either
of the form or power of godliness at Frederica, that I am sincerely glad
I am removed from it. There is none of those who did run well whom I
pity more than Mrs. Hawkins.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Her treating me in such a manner would
indeed have little affected me, had my own interests only been concerned.
I have been used to be betrayed, scorned, and insulted, by those I had
most laboured to serve. But when I reflect on her condition, my heart
bleeds for her.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley then refers to the accusation against his brother, to
the effect that, by the frequency of his public prayers, he
prevented the men attending to their proper work, and interrupted
the progress of the town and colony. He shows the
absurdity of this, by stating that, both at Frederica and Savannah,
not more than seven minutes were spent in reading
the public morning and evening prayers. Fourteen minutes
daily, in two public services, could hardly be considered an
unreasonable taxation of the people’s time. Wesley writes:
“These cannot be termed long prayers: no Christian assembly
ever used shorter.” And then he naively informs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Oglethorpe that these short prayers had no repetitions in
them! We should think not!<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Within a month after his return to Savannah, Wesley began
to carry out his high church principles. He refused to baptize
a child of Mr. Parker’s, second bailiff of the town, because
the parents objected to its being dipped. On Sundays, he
divided the public prayers, according to the original appointment
of the Church; reading the morning service at five; the
communion office and a sermon at eleven; and the evening
service at three. He also commenced visiting his parishioners
in order, from house to house, setting apart for this purpose
three hours every day.</p>

<p>He had no sooner begun, however, than his brother, wearied
with his life at Frederica, and full of abhorrence at the false-heartedness
of the people,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> unexpectedly presented himself
at Savannah. Places were exchanged, and John and Delamotte
instantly started off to the forsaken flock. They
arrived at Frederica on May 22nd, and remained until June
23rd. During this brief visit, Wesley read the commendatory
prayer over Mrs. Germain, at the point of death; made Mr.
Lassel’s will; arranged a small society-meeting, like that
which had been organised at Savannah; and reproved an
officer of a man-of-war for swearing. One of his congregation
said to him: “I like nothing you do; all your sermons are
satires upon particular persons. Besides, we are Protestants:
but as for you, we cannot tell what religion you are of. We
never heard of such a religion before; we know not what
to make of it. And then your private behaviour: all the
quarrels that have been here since your arrival have been
because of you; and there is neither man nor woman in the
town who minds a word you say.” The next day Wesley
returned to Savannah.</p>

<p>He was no sooner back than a large party of Indians
came, including several chiefs and an interpreter, with whom
he had several interviews. He now hoped that a door was
opened for the fulfilment of his intention to be a missionary
among the heathen; but when he informed Oglethorpe of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
purpose, the general objected, on the ground that there was
great danger of his being taken or killed by the French,
and that it was inexpedient to leave Savannah without a
minister. Wesley answered that, though the trustees of
Georgia had appointed him to the office of minister of Savannah,
this was done without his solicitation, desire, or
knowledge; and that he should not continue longer than until
his way was opened to go among the Indians. And so the
matter ended.</p>

<p>On the 26th of July, after spending a little more than five
months in Georgia, his brother Charles embarked for England.
At the same time, Wesley went again to ill-natured Frederica,
where he spent the next twelve weeks. Here he read, with
Delamotte, Bishop Beveridge’s “<i>Pandectæ Canonum Conciliorum</i>,”
and became more convinced than ever that both
particular and general councils may err. He set up a small
library; and as several Germans, through not understanding
the English tongue, were unable to join in the public service,
he agreed to meet them every day at noon, in his own house,
where, in their own language, he expounded to them a chapter
of the New Testament, and prayed with them. Finding,
however, that his prospects of doing good at Frederica became
less and less, he returned to Savannah on the 31st of
October, where he continued until the beginning of 1737.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wesley’s friends in England did not forget him.
The following was from his old acquaintance, Mr. Morgan,
and is now for the first time given to the public.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Oxon</span>, <i>November 27, 1735</i>.<br />

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,— ... Be pleased to let Mr. Ingham know that I intend
going to Yorkshire, if not hindered by my father. God has made Mr. Dickison
the instrument of awakening his landlord and landlady. I read to them
at Mr. Fox’s an hour every other day, in the Bishop of Man’s Catechism.
Mr. Fox and his wife, especially the former, are most zealous Christians;
and are earnestly bent on going to Georgia. So is Mr. Dickison, who is
‘an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile.’ I do not doubt but we
shall be able to send you a colony of thorough good Christians. I have
undertaken the care of Bocardo. I go there three days in the week, and
Mr. Broughton a fourth. I read every Sunday night to a cheerful
number of Christians at Mr. Fox’s. I could say a great deal respecting
our meetings, etc.; but I am obliged to steal even this time from the
holy Scriptures, in which I find more and more comfort every day.
Indeed, the Lord’s kingdom increaseth apace. My love to your brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and Mr. Ingham, and Mr. Delamotte; and best respects to Mr. Oglethorpe.
I should be very glad if you could spare me some of your
prayers, or anything else which may be of service to me.</p>

</div>

<p>Another unpublished letter lies before us, written by Sir
John Thorold, and breathing a most Christian spirit.
Omitting what is purely sentimental, we give the following
extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">London, St. James’s Palace</span>, <i>May 24, 1736</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I am unwilling to lose the opportunity of writing to you,
by Capt. Thompson, and inquiring after the welfare of yourself, your
brother, Mr. Ingham, Mr. Delamotte, and the whole colony of Georgia.
I have read the journal of your voyage to that new settlement, and can,
with pleasure, discern the footsteps of Divine Providence towards
you.... Our dear friend Mr. Broughton is curate at the Tower,
and has undertaken to preach to the poor prisoners in Ludgate every
Tuesday in the afternoon. Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Hervey propose
to enter into holy orders this next ordination. May they become burning
and shining lights in the Church! Sir John Phillips has been, for several
weeks, hindered from attending the societies, by reason of sickness and
infirmities. He piously allows Mr. Whitefield £20 per annum. Several
of Mr. Broughton’s late parishioners at Cowley forget not the assembling
of themselves together. Your friends at Oxford continue to exhort
and edify one another. Tell me what progress you make in spiritualizing
your flock; and what probability there is of the Lord opening the door
of faith to the Indians.... May the God of love keep you all knit
together in the bond of charity, and may you at last receive a beautiful
crown at the Lord’s hand, and enter amongst angels and archangels,
to sing everlasting songs of praise to the Lord Almighty. I desire your
prayers for me and mine.</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">J. Thorold.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>The next was from James Hutton:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>September 3, 1736.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I am this day twenty-one years old. Mr. Whitefield
has taken orders, and is in town to supply Mr. Broughton’s places at the
Tower and Ludgate prison. Mr. Broughton reads prayers every night to
a religious society that meet in Wapping chapel. Mr. Morgan is obliged
by his father’s orders to study physic at Leyden, where the name of
Wesley stinks as well as at Oxford. I had the happiness of seeing your
good mother, who came to town, in her way from Gainsborough, to Mr.
Hall first, and thence very soon to Tiverton. Mr. Law visited her at
Gainsborough, and again at London. Your mother desired her blessing
to you, and would have wrote, but had no time. She prayed for you and
blessed you. If all matters relating to receiving your fellowship are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
exact, write fresh ones, and send over. Take care to inquire carefully
and strictly concerning the mission of the Moravian bishop. I will
make what inquiries I can. A great deal depends upon the validity of
ordinations.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At the same time, Hervey at Oxford wrote:—“I am still a
most weak corrupt creature. But, blessed be the unmerited
mercy of God, and thanks be to your never-to-be-forgotten
example, that I am what I am! You have been both a
father and a friend to me. I heartily thank you, as for all
other favours, so especially for teaching me Hebrew.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>William Chapman, a student of Pembroke College, wrote
as follows:—“Your kind concern and repeated endeavours
for my spiritual good, while at Oxford, will not suffer me to
think that you have utterly lost all remembrance of me. I
sit every evening with Mr. Hervey, that great champion of the
Lord of hosts, and read five times a week to a religious society
in St. Ebbs’ parish. God and the angels be with you!”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Wesley, before leaving England, had begun to read the
mystics, and on November 23, 1736, addressed a long letter
to his brother Samuel, showing that, though he had been in
danger of embracing their bewildering heresies, he had now
abandoned them. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think the rock on which I had the nearest made shipwreck of the
faith was the writings of the mystics: under which term I comprehend
all, and only those, who slight any of the means of grace. I have drawn
up a short scheme of their doctrines, and beg your thoughts upon it, as
soon as you can conveniently. Give me them as particularly, fully, and
strongly as your time will permit. They may be of consequence, not
only to all this province, but to nations of Christians yet unborn.</p>

<p>“‘All means are not necessary for all men: therefore each person must
use such means, and such only, as he finds necessary for him. When the
end is attained the means cease.’</p>

<p>“‘Men utterly divested of free will, of self-love, and self-activity,
are entered into the passive state, and enjoy such a contemplation
as is not only above faith, but above sight—such as is entirely free from
images, thoughts, and discourse, and never interrupted by sins of infirmity,
or voluntary distractions. They have absolutely renounced their
reason and understanding; else they could not be guided by a Divine
light. They seek no clear or particular knowledge of anything, but only
an obscure, general knowledge, which is far better.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“‘Having thus attained the end, the means must cease. Hope is
swallowed up in love. Sight, or something more than sight, takes the
place of faith. All particular virtues they possess in the essence, and
therefore need not the distinct exercise of them. They work likewise all
good works essentially, not accidentally, and use all outward means,
only as they are moved thereto.’</p>

<p>“‘Public prayer, or any forms, they need not; for they pray without
ceasing. Sensible devotion in any prayer they despise; it being a great
hindrance to perfection. The Scripture they need not read; for it is only
His letter, with whom they converse face to face. Neither do they need
the Lord’s supper; for they never cease to <i>remember</i> Christ in the most
acceptable manner.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Such was the mystified balderdash which Wesley had been
in danger of adopting. He concludes his letter thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“May God deliver you and yours from all error, and all unholiness!
My prayers will never, I trust, be wanting for you. I am, dear brother,
my sister’s and your</p>

<p class="psig">
“Most affectionate brother,<br />
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>At the end of the year 1736, Wesley and Delamotte set out,
on foot, to Cowpen, missed their way, walked through a
cypress swamp, with the water breast high, and slept on the
ground in their wet clothes, which during the night were
frozen, and in the morning were white as snow. They then
started for Frederica, fell short of provisions, used bear’s flesh,
and proved it to be wholesome. Arriving on January 5, 1737,
they found the people, as they expected, cold and heartless.
Wesley’s life was repeatedly threatened; and, after spending
twenty more days in this unhappy place, he departed from
Frederica for ever. In his passage to Savannah he read a
volume containing the works of Nicholas Machiavel, and
formed the deliberate opinion, “that if all the other doctrines
of devils, which have been committed to writing, were collected
together in one volume, it would fall short of this; and that
should a prince form himself by this book, so calmly recommending
hypocrisy, treachery, lying, robbery, oppression,
adultery, whoredom, and murder of all kinds, Domitian or
Nero would be an angel of light compared to that man.”</p>

<p>Wesley had now been fifty-two weeks in America, twenty-four
of which he had spent at Savannah, and the rest at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
Frederica and at other places between the two. He remained
forty-six weeks longer. How was he occupied? And what
were his troubles?</p>

<p>Delamotte was teaching between thirty and forty children
at Savannah to read, write, and cast accounts, and Wesley
catechized them every Saturday and Sunday afternoon.
Every sabbath he had three public services, at five in the
morning, twelve at mid-day, and three in the afternoon; and
then at night as many of his parishioners as desired it met at
his house, with whom he spent an hour in prayer, singing,
and mutual exhortation. A similar meeting was held in the
same place every Wednesday night, and selecter ones on all
the other evenings of the week.</p>

<p>There being no immediate prospect of commencing a mission
among the heathen, Wesley, Delamotte, and Ingham
consulted together, and agreed that the last mentioned should
return to England; and accordingly, after spending exactly
fifty-five weeks in Georgia, he embarked for home, having
literally done next to nothing either for the colonists or the
Indians, with the exception of composing, in Dr. Byrom’s
shorthand, a catalogue of half the words in the Indian language,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
in a house built for him near the Indian town, a few
miles from Savannah. The chief object of sending Ingham
to England was to obtain more help for the colonists. In a
letter dated February 16, 1737, and addressed to a friend in
Lincoln College, Oxford, Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is great need that God should put it into the hearts of some,
to come over to us, and labour with us in His harvest. But I should not
desire any to come unless on the same views and conditions with us;
without any temporal wages, other than food and raiment, the plain
conveniences of life. For one or more, in whom was this mind, there
would be full employment in the province: either in assisting Mr.
Delamotte or me, while we were present here; or in supplying our places
when abroad; or in visiting the poor people in the smaller settlements
as well as at Frederica, all of whom are as sheep without a shepherd.</p>

<p>“By these labours of love might any that desired it be trained up for
the harder task of preaching the gospel to the heathen. The difficulties
he must then encounter God only knows; probably martyrdom would
conclude them. But those we have hitherto met with have been small.
Persecution, you know, is the portion of every follower of Christ, wherever
his lot is cast; but it has hitherto extended no farther than words with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
regard to us, unless in one or two inconsiderable instances. Still, every
man that would come hither ought to be willing and ready to embrace
the severer kinds of it.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Oglethorpe’s troubles had begun. From a letter
which Wesley wrote to him, on February 24, 1737, we learn
that Sir Robert Walpole had turned against the general, and
parliament had resolved to make a strict scrutiny into Georgian
affairs. The trustees had charged Oglethorpe with misapplying
moneys, and with abusing his entrusted power. Wesley
adds: “Perhaps in some things you have shown you are but
a man: perhaps I myself may have a little to complain of:
but oh what a train of benefits have I received to lay in
the balance against it! I bless God that ever you was born.
I acknowledge His exceeding mercy in casting me into your
hands. I own your generous kindness all the time we were at
sea. I am indebted to you for a thousand favours here.
Though all men should revile you, yet will not I.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Sinister rumours were circulated in reference to Wesley, as
well as Oglethorpe. Hence the following hitherto unpublished
letter, endorsed by Wesley thus:—“The Trustees’ Letter,
June 17, 1737, fully acquitting me:”—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>Trustees of Georgia to the Rev. J. Wesley.</i><br />
<br />
“<span class="smcap">Georgia Office</span>, <i>June 15, 1737</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—The Rev. Mr. Burton has this day laid before the trustees a
letter from you to them, dated Savannah, March 4, 1737, wherein you
express a concern that they should receive an accusation of your embezzling
any part of their goods, and likewise a desire to know the name
of your accuser.</p>

<p>“The trustees have ordered me to assure you, that they are very much
surprised at any apprehensions you have of such accusation being brought
before them. No complaint of any kind has been laid before them
relating to you. They have never as a board, nor has any of them
privately, heard of one; nor have they the least suspicion of any ground
for one. They would not (if they had received any) form a judgment of
you without acquainting you with the accusation, and the name of the
accuser. At the same time, they believe you will think it reasonable to let
them know who has informed you that any such accusation has been
brought before them, and that, for the future, you will not believe nor
listen to any private informations or insinuations, that must make you
uneasy, and may lead you to distrust the justice of the trustees, and
the regard they have for you.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“The trustees are very sensible of the great importance of the work you
have engaged in; and they hope God will prosper the undertaking, and
support you in it; for they have much at heart, not only the success of
the colony in general, but the progress of piety among the people, as well
as the conversion of the Indians. They are very glad to find that Mr.
Causton has seconded your endeavours to suppress vice and immorality,
and that a reformation gains ground, as you observe it does. The trustees
will take into consideration your application in favour of Robert Haws,
and have a regard to it.</p>

<p class="psig">
“I am, sir, your most obedient servant,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Benjamin Martin</span>, <i>Secretary</i>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The following letter, also now first published, refers to the
same subject, besides containing other information which we
hope will be found not devoid of interest. It was addressed
to “The Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Savannah, in Georgia:”—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Osset</span>, <i>October 19, 1737</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,—By your silence one would suspect that you were
offended at my last letter. Am I your enemy because I tell you the
truth? But perhaps I was too severe. Forgive me then. However, I am
sure that, by soaring too high in your own imaginations, you have had a
great downfall in your spiritual progress. Be lowly, therefore, in your
own eyes. Humble yourself before the Lord, and He will lift you up. I
do assure you it is out of pure love, and with concern, that I write. I
earnestly wish your soul’s welfare. O pray for mine also. The Lord
preserve you!</p>

<p>“Could you, think you, live upon the income of your fellowship? If
you can, do. The trustees are indeed very willing to support you, and
they take it ill that anybody should say you have been too expensive.
But the Bishop of London (as I have heard), and some others, have been
offended at your expenses. And not indeed altogether without reason,
because you declared at your leaving England that you should want
scarcely anything. I just give you these hints. Pray for direction, and
then act as you judge best.</p>

<p>“Charles is so reserved: I know little about him: he neither writes to
me, nor comes to see me: what he intends is best known to himself.
Mr. Hutton’s family go on exceedingly well. Your friend Mr. Morgan
(I hear) either has, or is about publishing a book, to prove that every one
baptized with water is regenerate. All friends at Oxford go on well. Mr.
Kinchin, Mr. Hutchins, Mr. Washington, Bell, Turney, Hervey, Watson,
are all zealous. Mr. Atkinson labours under severe trials in Westmoreland;
but is steady, and sincere, and an excellent Christian. Dick Smith is
weak, but not utterly gone. Mr. Robson, and Grieves, are but indifferent:
the latter is married to a widow, and teaching school at Northampton.
Mr. Thompson, of Queen’s, has declared his resolution of following
Christ.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley’s ideas of religion, at this period, may be gathered
from the following extracts from a letter, dated “Savannah,
March 28, 1737,” and addressed to “William Wogan, Esq., in
Spring Gardens, London.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I entirely agree with you, that religion is love, and peace, and joy in
the Holy Ghost; that, as it is the happiest, so it is the cheerfulest thing
in the world; that it is utterly inconsistent with moroseness, sourness,
severity, and indeed with whatever is not according to the softness, sweetness,
and gentleness of Christ Jesus. I believe it is equally contrary to all
preciseness, stiffness, affectation, and unnecessary singularity. I allow,
too, that prudence, as well as zeal, is of the utmost importance in the
Christian life. But I do not yet see any possible case wherein trifling
conversation can be an instance of it. In the following scriptures I take
all such to be flatly forbidden: Matt. xii. 36; Eph. v. 4, and iv. 29;
Col. iv. 6.</p>

<p>“That I shall be laughed at for this, I know; so was my Master. I
am not for a stern, austere manner of conversing. No: let all the cheerfulness
of faith be there, all the joyfulness of hope, all the amiable sweetness—the
winning easiness of love. If we must have art, ‘<i>Hic mihi
erunt artes</i>.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Again, in another letter, written to Mrs. Chapman a day
later, he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You seem to apprehend that I believe religion to be inconsistent with
cheerfulness, and with a social friendly temper. So far from it, that I
am convinced, as true religion cannot be without cheerfulness, so steady
cheerfulness cannot be without true religion. I am equally convinced
that religion has nothing sour, austere, unsociable, unfriendly in it; but
on the contrary, implies the most winning sweetness, the most amiable
softness and gentleness. Are you for having as much cheerfulness as you
can? So am I. Do you endeavour to keep alive your taste for all the
truly innocent pleasures of life? So do I. Do you refuse no pleasure
but what is a hindrance to some greater good, or has a tendency to some
evil? It is my very rule. In particular, I pursue this rule in eating,
which I seldom do without much pleasure. I know it is the will of God,
that I should enjoy every pleasure that leads to my taking pleasure in
Him, and in such a measure as most leads to it. We are to do nothing
but what, directly or indirectly, leads to our holiness; and to do every such
thing with this design, and in such a measure as may most promote it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“I am not mad, my dear friend, for asserting these to be the words of
truth and soberness; neither are any of those, either in England or here,
who have hitherto attempted to follow me. I am and must be an example
to my flock; not indeed in my prudential rules, but, in some measure, in
my spirit and life and conversation. Yet all of them are, in your sense
of the word, unlearned, and most of them of low understanding; and
still not one of them has been, as yet, in any case of conscience which
was not solved. As to the nice distinctions you speak of, it is you, my
friend, who are lost in them. We have no need of nice distinctions; for
I exhort all, and dispute with none. I feed my brethren in Christ, as He
giveth me power, with the pure, unmixed milk of the word; and those
who are as little children receive it, not as the word of man, but as the
word of God.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These are important letters, as tending to refute the commonly
received opinion, that, at this period of his history,
Wesley was morose, sour, gloomy, and in fact thought that
cheerfulness was inconsistent with religion. His views and
some of his practices might seem to many to be peculiar; but
he was a cheerful and happy man, even amid the vigils,
fastings, and solitudes of Georgia. Some of his views were
novel, but they were not incompatible with happiness. He
writes: “When I first landed at Savannah, a gentlewoman
said, ‘I assure you, sir, you will see as <i>well dressed</i> a
congregation on Sunday as most you have seen in London.’
I did so; and soon after I took occasion to expound those
scriptures which relate to dress; and all the time that I afterward
ministered at Savannah, I saw neither gold in the
church, nor costly apparel, but the congregation in general was
almost constantly clothed in plain clean linen or woollen.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
This wears an aspect of anchorite severity, but still Wesley
and his plain-robed followers were happy.</p>

<p>In April, 1737, Wesley began to learn the Spanish language,
in order to converse with his Jewish parishioners.
Easter being in the same month, he “had every day in this
great and holy week a sermon and the holy communion.”
Finding that a clergyman in Carolina had been marrying some
of his (Wesley’s) parishioners, without either banns or licence,
he set out for Charlestown to put a stop to such proceedings.
Mr. Garden, the Bishop of London’s commissary, assured him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
he would take care no such irregularity should be committed
for the future. At Garden’s request, Wesley preached a sermon
on, “whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world”;
which led a man of education and character to object—“Why
if this be Christianity, a Christian must have more courage
than Alexander the Great.”</p>

<p>Returning to Savannah, in the month of May, Wesley
found one of his congregation, who had been exemplarily
religious, turned a deist; and expressed the opinion that bad
a religion as Popery is, no religion is worse; and that a baptized
infidel is twofold worse than even a bigoted papist.
This was only one of Wesley’s trials. A wicked woman,
whom he had offended, decoyed him into her house, threw
him down, and, with her scissors, cut off from one side of his
head the whole of those long locks of auburn hair, which he
had been accustomed to keep in the most perfect order. After
this, he preached at Savannah with his hair long on one
side and short on the other, those sitting on the side which
had been cut observing, “What a cropped head of hair the
young parson has.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>At Whitsuntide, four of his scholars, after being instructed
daily for several weeks, were admitted to the Lord’s table,
and many of the other children evinced a remarkable seriousness
in their behaviour and conversation. This was doubtless
a cause of great joy both to Wesley and his friend Delamotte,
each of whom taught a school, and, like all schoolmasters,
met with discouragements. A part of the boys in Delamotte’s
school wore stockings and shoes, and the others not. The
former ridiculed the latter. Delamotte tried to put a stop to
this uncourteous banter, but told Wesley he had failed.
Wesley replied, “I think I can cure it. If you will take
charge of my school next week I will take charge of yours,
and will try.” The exchange was made, and on Monday
morning Wesley went into school barefoot. The children
seemed surprised, but without any reference to past jeerings
Wesley kept them at their work. Before the week was ended,
the shoeless ones began to gather courage; and some of the
others, seeing their minister and master come without shoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and stockings, began to copy his example, and thus the evil
was effectually cured.”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>In the early summer of 1737, Whitefield wrote to Wesley,
telling him of his success in England. A young country lad
had brought him a peck of apples seven miles upon his back,
as a token of gratitude for the benefit he had derived
from Whitefield’s ministry, and had such a sense of the
Divine presence that he walked, for the most part, with his
hat off his head. God was also moving on the hearts of some
young ladies. Whitefield continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The devil, I find, has a particular spite against weekly communion;
but I am in hope we shall have the sacrament administered every Sunday
at the cathedral. It would have been mentioned to the bishop ere now,
but Oxford friends advised to defer it till next summer.</p>

<p>“But now I have mentioned the bishop: alas! how should I tremble
to tell you how I have been continually disturbed with thoughts, that I,
a worm taken from a common public-house, should, ere I die, be one
myself. Your earnest prayers, surely, will not be wanting for me, that I
may not split on that most dangerous of all rocks—worldly ambition.
Parsonages, I believe, are providing for me; but I trust Satan will never
catch me by pluralities, or induce me to take upon me anything inconsistent
with the duty of a disciple of Jesus Christ. I hope our friends all
continue steadfast and zealous at Oxford. My love to the young merchant,
whose example I hope we shall all be enabled to follow, if God requires
our assistance in Georgia. O may you go on and prosper, and, in the
strength of God, make the devil’s kingdom shake about his ears! I
received benefit by your father’s ‘Advice to a Young Clergyman.’”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whitefield’s dream about being made a bishop is amusing;
and yet Providence and grace made him greater than a
bishop.</p>

<p>Wesley still felt intensely anxious respecting the heathen.
In July he met a Frenchman, who had lived several months
among the Chicasaws, and wrote to Dr. Humphreys as
follows:—<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Concerning the conversion of the heathen, where is the seed sown, the
<i>sanguis martyrum</i>? Do we hear of any who have sealed the faith with
their blood in all this vast continent? Or do we read of any church
flourishing in any age or nation without this seed first sown there? Give
me leave, sir, to speak my thoughts freely. When God shall put it into
the hearts of some of His servants, whom He hath already delivered from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
earthly hopes and fears, to join hand in hand in this labour of love;
when out of these He shall have chosen one or more, to magnify Him
in the sight of the heathen by dying, not with a stoical or Indian
indifference, but blessing and praying for their murderers, and praising
God in the midst of flame with joy unspeakable and full of glory, then
the rest, waxing bold by their sufferings, shall go forth in the name of the
Lord God, and by the power of His might cast down every high thing
that exalteth itself against the faith of Christ. Then shall ye see Satan,
the grand ruler of this New World, as lightning fall from heaven!”</p>
</div>

<p>Oh for missionaries like these! Wesley’s notions are right.
Men going merely because others send them, or men going
merely to obtain a livelihood, are not the men to convert the
inhabitants of lands like Africa, India, Japan, and China.
To make an impression there, men must be animated with
the martyrs’ spirit. Church history, including the history
of missions, affords abundant proof of this. Mere duty-doing
ministers are bad enough in England, but they are vastly
worse when among the heathen. Money spent upon them
there is worse than wasted; for their cold perfunctory labours
produce, upon the whole, a bad effect instead of good. The
greatest boon the church could now receive from the hands of
God would be a multiplication of ministers and missionaries
like those which Wesley was sighing for in Georgia.</p>

<p>From Wesley’s private manuscript journal, we learn that in
July, by going from house to house, he took a census of his
parishioners, and computed that there were in Savannah 518
inhabitants, of whom 149 were under sixteen years of age.
Frederica was without a minister, though three hundred acres
of land had been granted by the trustees for a church
establishment in that unhappy town.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Other places with
scanty populations were equally destitute. New Ebenezer
had the Moravians; and Darien had Mr. M’Leod, a serious,
resolute, and pious Presbyterian: but this seems to have been
all the ministerial agency existing in Georgia. Hence the
following letter, addressed by Wesley to his friends at
Oxford:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <i>September 8, 1737</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“ ... Long since, I begun to visit my parishioners in order, from
house to house; but I could not go on two days longer. The sick were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
increasing so fast as to require all the time I had to spare—from one
to five in the afternoon. Nor is even that enough to see them all, as
I would do, daily. In Frederica and all the smaller settlements here are
above five hundred sheep almost without a shepherd. What a single
man can do is neither seen nor felt. Where are ye who are very zealous
for the Lord of hosts? Who will rise up with me against the wicked?
Whose spirit is moved within him to prepare himself for publishing glad
tidings to those on whom the Sun of Righteousness never yet arose? Do
you ask what you shall have? Why, all you desire: food to eat, raiment
to put on, a place where to lay your head, and a crown of life that fadeth
not away! Do you seek means of building up yourselves in the knowledge
and love of God? I know of no place under heaven where there are
more than in this place. Does your heart burn within you to turn many
others to righteousness? Behold, the whole land, thousands of thousands
are before you! I will resign to any of you all or any part of my charge.
Choose what seemeth good in your own eyes. There are within these
walls children of all ages and dispositions. Who will bring them up
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, till they are meet to be
preachers of righteousness? Here are adults from the farthest parts of
Europe, and Asia, and the inmost kingdoms of Africa; add to these
the known and unknown nations of this vast continent, and you will
indeed have a great multitude which no man can number.”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>
</div>

<p>While Wesley was thus longing for help, events were
transpiring, by which he himself within three months was
driven out of Georgia, and obliged to return to England.
This was the closing scene in Wesley’s missionary life, and
though a painful one it must not be shirked. All the facts
in the writer’s possession shall be given, and the reader shall
have materials to form his own opinion. The chief actors in
the scene, besides Wesley himself, were Sophia Christiana
Hopkey, Thomas Causton, and William Williamson.</p>

<p>Causton was one of the first company of emigrants, and
landed in Georgia with Oglethorpe, in February, 1733. He
was a man of no substance, and his character was not as good
as it might have been. In fact, he left England in disgrace,
having practised a fraud upon the public revenue. He was
naturally proud, covetous, cunning, and deceitful. By his
clever rascality he wriggled himself into Oglethorpe’s favour,
and, on the arrival of the few emigrant gaol-birds in the
Savannah river, was appointed a sort of dictator of the infant
settlement, and had charge of the stores which the trustees sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
over for the use of the colonists. We have already seen that,
even when Wesley left for England at the end of the year
1737, the inhabitants of Savannah were not more than 518 in
number, of whom only 369 were adult males and females. This
was no large kingdom; but Thomas Causton was a large man,
because he was at the head of it. Indeed, the molehill empire
seems to have magnified itself to the utmost extent possible,
by the introduction of law, the establishment of courts, the
appointment of officers, the election of juries, and the adoption
of everything else within its power which was likely to
make it a pompous minikin miniature of the great system of
government at home. Causton was “chief magistrate,” and
of course a “chief” had subordinates under him. There was
a recorder, also a bailiff. There were constables, and tithingmen,
and other great functionaries, all armed with solemn
authority to rule, govern, and keep in order, first themselves,
and then about five hundred men, women, and children,
including John Wesley the Oxford priest, and Charles
Delamotte the merchant master of almost a ragged school.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Of all the great powers, however, in this log-built village
of five hundred souls, Thomas Causton, in his own estimation,
and in fact, was greatest. The other Tom Thumb magistrates
were ciphers in his august presence. Sometimes,
indeed, he would ask their opinion in public on the state
matters of the great city of Savannah; but it was principally
to have the pleasure of uttering an opinion of his own,
directly opposite to theirs. Juries he threatened without the
least compunction, and especially when their verdicts disagreed
with his inclinations. As his power increased, so did
his pride, haughtiness, and cruelty. The court in which this
fraudulent refugee—we beg his pardon, this “chief magistrate”—expounded
law and dispensed justice, was guarded by
eight freeholders, with an officer to direct their movements,
all armed with guns and bayonets. Seated, in such high
dignity, and so far above his fellows, upon the judicial bench,
it was beneath his office to sit uncovered; and hence he almost
invariably wore his hat, even when administering an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
oath. Should any foolish wight be bold enough to oppose,
in the least degree, his arbitrary proceedings, the “chief
magistrate” at once threatened the impudent recusant with
the stocks, the whipping-post, and a lodging in the log-house
prison. Even his fellow officials were treated with scant
respect. In December, 1734, the trustees sent a Mr. Gordon
from England, to act as magistrate; but Causton, not liking
a compeer, refused him provisions from the store, and he was
obliged to leave. Indeed, Causton, who had sufficient cleverness
to induce Oglethorpe, despite his roguery in England, to
make him magistrate in Savannah, seems to have used the
same worldly cunning in allowing none to be his subordinates
except those whom he could, with the utmost ease, twist to
his own purposes. Mr. Bailiff Parker, mentioned in Wesley’s
journal, had nothing to support himself and his large family,
except what he earned by his daily labour as a sawyer. He
was a man of no education, and was an absolute slave to
liquor. Another bailiff was a man of the name of Daru,
nearly seventy years old, and crazed in both body and mind;
and another was R. Gilbert, who could neither read nor write.
Causton’s despotic career was of short duration. The same
grand jury which found, under Causton’s guidance, ten bills
against Wesley, immediately proceeded to examine the official
doings of their own illustrious “chief magistrate;” and
found charges against him, to the effect that he had grossly
abused his power as keeper of the public stores, and that he
had hindered people settling on the lands that the trustees had
allotted them. These and other charges, dated September 1,
1737, were sent to England; and the result was—Causton, in
October, 1738, was turned out of all his offices, and the store
was sold to pay the trustees’ debts; Causton’s certified accounts
were refused by the trustees as incorrect; William
Williamson was made recorder, and Henry Parker (the
drunken uneducated sawyer above mentioned) was made first
magistrate; and, finally, Causton, the great man who prosecuted
Wesley, and drove him from Georgia, settled down at
Oxstead, three miles from Savannah; and there, we hope,
he lived a more honest life than he had done in England.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Sophia Christiana Hopkey was the niece of Thomas Causton’s
wife. William Williamson, who became her husband,
was a young adventurer, who arrived in Georgia a short time
after Wesley did.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> And now, with these explanations, let us
look at the miserable business, which, in a life of Wesley,
cannot be omitted.</p>

<p>Wesley landed in Georgia on February 5, 1736, and seems
at once to have become acquainted with Miss Hopkey. Oglethorpe,
Charles Wesley, Ingham, and fifty other settlers set
out immediately for Frederica. The young lady went with
them; and, on March 22, Wesley wrote to his brother concerning
her as follows: “I conjure you, spare no time, no
address or pains, to learn the true cause of the former distress
of my friend. I much doubt you are in the right. God
forbid that she should again, in like manner, miss the mark.
Watch over her; keep her as much as possible. Write to me,
how I ought to write to her.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Miss Hopkey was a young lady of good sense, and elegant
in person and manners. She was introduced to Wesley as a
sincere inquirer after salvation, and soon took every possible
opportunity of being in his company, and requested him to
assist her in studying French. Oglethorpe also did his best
to help on a courtship. Meanwhile, Wesley was seized with
fever, which confined him for nearly a week; and the young
lady (who would hardly allow Delamotte to do anything for
his friend) attended him night and day. She even consulted
Oglethorpe what kind of female dress Wesley liked the best,
and therefore came always dressed in white, neatly and simply
elegant. Young Delamotte began to be suspicious, and asked
Wesley if he meant to marry Miss Hopkey. Delamotte’s
question puzzled Wesley, but, perceiving that Delamotte was
prejudiced against the lady, he waived an answer. The next
step taken was to consult David Nitschmann, the Moravian
bishop. Nitschmann’s answer was: “Marriage is not unlawful;
but whether it is now expedient for you, and whether this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
lady is a proper wife for you, ought to be maturely weighed.”
Wesley’s perplexity was increased, and he now resolved to
submit the matter to the elders of the Moravian church.
When he entered the house where they were met together, he
found Delamotte in the midst of them. On naming his business,
Nitschmann said: “We have considered your case; will
you abide by our decision?” After some hesitation, Wesley
replied, “I will.” “Then,” said Nitschmann, “we advise you
to proceed no further in the matter!” Wesley answered,
“The will of the Lord be done!” “From this time,” says
Henry Moore, “he avoided everything that tended to continue
the intimacy with Miss Hopkey, and behaved with the greatest
caution towards her.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The whole of this is painfully ludicrous. Mr. Moore, in a
manuscript letter before us, says that he had the account
from Wesley’s own lips, and that he is not aware that it was
ever given to any one except himself. He adds that
Dr. Coke knew nothing of it, and that Wesley refrained from
publishing the whole of the affair in his printed journal,
<i>chiefly</i> through tenderness to General Oglethorpe. It might
be so; but we greatly doubt the correctness of Moore’s assertion,
that, from the time Wesley consulted the Moravian
elders, he “avoided everything that tended to continue the
intimacy.” Wesley was in love, and, like all lovers, he did, not
wicked, but foolish things. Let us look at some other facts.</p>

<p>At this period, the summer of 1736, Wesley’s method of
preaching, and his manner of life, excited great attention in
the small settlement of Savannah; and there were not a few
who charged him with making the people idle by summoning
them so frequently to public prayers. His more than ordinary
friendship with Miss Hopkey was also a subject of common
conversation.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> He was looked upon as a Roman Catholic—(1)
Because he rigidly excluded all Dissenters from the holy
communion, until they first gave up their faith and principles,
and, like Richard Turner and his sons, submitted to be rebaptized
by him; (2) Because Roman Catholics were received
by him as saints; (3) Because he endeavoured to establish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
and enforce confession, penance, and mortification; mixed
wine with water at the sacrament; and appointed deaconesses
in accordance with what he called the Apostolic Constitutions.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
He was, in point of fact, a Puseyite, a hundred years
before Dr. Pusey flourished.</p>

<p>Miss Hopkey was put under his ghostly care. She was
one of his early morning congregation, and constantly went
to his lodgings, in order to be further instructed.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He fell
in love with her; and there can be little doubt that he made
proposals to marry her, and, if his own inclinations had been
carried out, the marriage would have been completed.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The
following extracts are taken from his unpublished journal.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1736. October 16.—Frederica. “Poor Miss Sophy was scarce the shadow
of what she was when I left her. I endeavoured to convince her of it, but
in vain. And to put it effectually out of my power to do so, she was
resolved to return to England immediately. I tried to divert her from her
fatal resolution of going to England, and, after several fruitless attempts,
I at length prevailed. Nor was it long before she more than recovered
the ground she had lost.”</p>

<p>“October 25.—I took boat for Savannah with Miss Sophy.”</p>

<p>“In the beginning of December, I advised Miss Sophy to sup earlier,
and not immediately before she went to bed. She did so, and on this
little circumstance what an inconceivable train of consequences depend.
Not only—</p>

<p class="center">
‘All the colour of my remaining life’<br />
</p>

<p class="nind">for her; but perhaps all my happiness too, in time and in eternity.”</p>

<p>“February 5, 1737.—One of the most remarkable dispensations of Providence
towards me began to show itself this day. For many days after, I
could not at all judge which way the scale would turn; nor was it fully
determined till March 4th, on which day God commanded me to pull out
my right eye; and, by His grace, I determined to do so: but, being slack
in the execution, on Saturday, March 12th, God being very merciful to
me, my friend performed what I could not.”</p>
</div>

<p>What is the meaning of this? Two other extracts from the
same journal will show.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“March 7.—I walked with Mr. Causton to his country lot, and plainly
felt that, had God given me such a retirement with the companion I
desired, I should have forgot the work for which I was born, and have set
up my rest in this world.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“March 8.—Miss Sophy engaged herself to Mr. Williamson, a person
not remarkable for handsomeness, neither for greatness, neither for wit,
or knowledge, or sense, and least of all for religion; and on Saturday,
March 12th” [four days after!] “they were married at Purrysburg,—this
being the day which completed the year from my first speaking
to her. What Thou doest, O God, I know not now, but I shall know
hereafter.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such is Wesley’s own statement. The disappointment was
a most painful blow. Forty-nine years after, he wrote, in
reference to this event, “I remember when I read these words
in the church at Savannah, ‘Son of man, behold, I take from
thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke,’ I was pierced
through as with a sword, and could not utter a word more.
But our comfort is, He that made the heart can heal the
heart.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> He also wrote to his brother Samuel at the time,
who replied, “I am sorry you are disappointed in the match,
because you are very unlikely to find another.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>With this evidence before us, it is difficult to give credence
to Henry Moore’s assertion, “that Wesley never allowed
himself to <i>determine</i> on a marriage with Miss Hopkey.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> But
in addition to all this, there is the testimony of the young
lady herself, contained in her affidavit, given to the Savannah
court, and which Wesley inserts in the private journal already
mentioned. In that document she avers that she was committed
to the care of Mr. John Wesley, the missionary, by
her relatives; that he proposed marriage to her; and that
he further proposed that, as she might not like his present
wandering way of life, he would settle in Savannah. She
adds that, about three days before she married Williamson,
she was visited by Wesley, who urged her to tell him whether
she had not been overpersuaded or forced to agree to marry
Williamson by her friends, and whether such a marriage
might not still be prevented. He also added that, if there
was anything in his way of life (by which she understood him
to mean fastings and other mortifications), which she disliked,
he would make all these things easy to her, in case she would
consent to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>Such is the substance of Sophy’s statement. How is it
possible, in the face of all this, to believe Henry Moore’s
statement, that there was no intimacy between Wesley and
Miss Hopkey, from the time that he consulted the Moravian
elders?</p>

<p>We grudge the space that has been devoted to this subject;
but perhaps the following reasons will be accepted by the
reader, as an apology for the tax upon his patience.</p>

<p>1. The matter, though trivial in itself, has been made
important by the conflicting statements of the biographers.
Mr. Moore says Wesley never came to the determination to
marry her. Dr. Whitehead says he did intend to marry
her. Southey agrees with Whitehead; Mr. Watson presumes
that Mr. Moore is a better authority than Dr. Whitehead;
Mr. Jackson seems to think the same. We have given
all the facts within our reach, and leave the reader to form
his own opinion.</p>

<p>2. Though the courtship of young people is an ordinary,
commonplace sort of thing, inconceivably great events were
dependent upon the result of this. John Wesley was thirty-three
years old, and was perfectly justified in seeking to obtain
a wife; neither is there anything to be found fault with in his
intercourse with Miss Hopkey, unless it was his silly simplicity
in asking the opinion, if not consent, of the Moravians. The
young lady, also, was beautiful, and accomplished, and, to all
human appearance, pious. Her uncle was a respectable
rascal; but that was no fault of hers. We know nothing to
her prejudice before she became a wife, except that it might
have been more decorously prudent if she had allowed Delamotte
to nurse Wesley in his fever instead of doing it, day
and night, herself; and that there was certainly an impetuous
haste, not to be commended, in her marrying Mr. Williamson
only four days after he first proposed to her. Excepting this,
the friendship, courtship, or whatever else the reader likes to
call it, between Wesley and his “poor Sophy” seems to have
been sincere, pure, honourable, and, in the opinion of Oglethorpe,
who was not ill qualified to judge, desirable. But,
supposing the courtship had ended in marriage, is it likely
that we should ever have heard of Wesley at Bristol, Kingswood,
Kennington Common, and Moorfields? Is it likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
that there would ever have been any “United Societies of the
People called Methodists”? Should we have ever heard of
either the Methodism of the past or present? Perhaps an
equally great work might have been witnessed; but the great
Head of the church must have wrought it by other agencies
and means; for had John Wesley married Sophia Christiana
Hopkey, the probability is that, instead of returning to
England and beginning the greatest religious revival of
modern times, he would have settled in Georgia, and, like
another Xavier, have spent a most spiritual and devoted life
in converting Indian and other kinds of heathen. The results
of such a life might have been glorious. Who can tell
what might have been its influence upon the civilisation and
perpetuation of the nobly formed aboriginal inhabitants of
the vast American continent? Would America, in the decline
of the nineteenth century, have been inhabited by
European strangers, or by educated, civilised, hardworking,
prosperous descendants of the wild Indians of the woods?
These are useless questions, because questions none of us
can answer; but the mere suggestion of such points will
serve to show that Wesley’s courtship in Georgia was pregnant
with infinite momentousness. “The Lord reigneth; let
the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad: clouds
and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and judgment
are the habitation of His throne” (Ps. xcvii. 1, 2).</p>

<p>3. Then a third reason, for dwelling at so great a length
on Wesley’s courtship, is, that the courtship was very improperly
mixed up with the subsequent troubles which led to
his almost forceful departure from the Georgian colony. But
this brings us to the remainder of Wesley’s Georgian history,
which shall now be given as succinctly as possible.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Wesley was an extreme ritualist.
He himself, nearly a dozen years subsequent to his flight
from Georgia, gives us a specimen of his high church bigotry
and intolerance. Having inserted in his journal a beautiful
letter written to him by John Martin Bolzius, he, under
the date of September, 1749, remarks: “What a truly
Christian piety and simplicity breathe in these lines! And
yet this very man, when I was at Savannah, did I refuse
to admit to the Lord’s table, because he was not baptized;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
that is, not baptized by a minister who had been episcopally
ordained. Can any one carry high church zeal higher than
this? How well have I been since beaten with mine own
staff!”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Wesley still paid pastoral attentions to Mrs. Williamson
as one of his parishioners. Her not too accomplished husband
took umbrage at this, and, eight days after her marriage,
forbade her attending his place of worship, or ever to speak
to him again.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Notwithstanding this interdict, however, we
find her on the 3rd of July at a sacramental service, at the
conclusion of which Wesley mentioned certain things which
he thought reprovable in her behaviour. This made her extremely
angry, and, three days later, Causton, accompanied
by the bailiff and the recorder, came to demand an explanation.
Wesley gave his visitors to understand that, in the
execution of his office, and acting without respect of persons,
he might find it necessary to repel one of Causton’s family
from the holy communion. He further told the “chief magistrate”
what the people of Savannah were saying against his
magisterial proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> All this made the coming storm
more threatening.</p>

<p>Some weeks elapsed; and then, on August 7, five months
after her marriage, Wesley refused to allow Mrs. Williamson
to join in the Lord’s supper. The next day, Mr. Recorder
issued a warrant for the apprehension of “John Wesley,
clerk,” and commanding the constables and tithingmen to
bring him before one of the bailiffs of Savannah, to answer the
complaint of William Williamson for defaming his wife, and
refusing to administer to her the sacrament of the Lord’s
supper, in a public congregation, without cause; “by which
the said William Williamson was damaged one thousand
pounds sterling.”</p>

<p>Wesley was arrested and brought before Mr. Bailiff Parker
and Mr. Recorder Christie. His answer to the charge was,
“that the giving or refusing the Lord’s supper being a matter
purely ecclesiastical, he could not acknowledge their power to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
interrogate him concerning it.” The bailiff told him he must
appear at the next Savannah court; and Williamson demanded
bail for his appearance, but the officials ruled that
Wesley’s word was in itself sufficient.</p>

<p>Two days later, Causton called on Wesley, and demanded
that he should send to Mrs. Williamson, in writing, “the
reasons for repelling her before the whole congregation.”
Wesley complied, and wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>To Mrs. Sophia Williamson.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“At Mr. Causton’s request, I write once more. The rules whereby
I proceed are these:—</p>

<p>“‘So many as intend to be partakers of the holy communion shall
signify their names to the curate, at least some time the day before.’ This
you did not do.</p>

<p>“‘And if any of these have done any wrong to his neighbours, by word
or deed, so that the congregation be thereby offended, the curate shall
advertise him, that in anywise he presume not to come to the Lord’s
table until he hath openly declared himself to have truly repented.’</p>

<p>“If you offer yourself at the Lord’s table on Sunday, I will advertise you
(as I have done more than once) wherein you have done wrong. And
when you have openly declared yourself to have truly repented, I will
administer to you the mysteries of God.</p>

<p>
“<i>August 11, 1737.</i></p>
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>On receiving this, Causton began to read, to as many of the
people as he could collect together, extracts from the letters
which Wesley had written to himself or to his niece, from the
beginning of their acquaintance, adding comments of his own,
to Wesley’s disadvantage. Others of Causton’s family were
assiduous in their endeavours to convince their neighbours
that Wesley had repelled Mrs. Williamson from the communion
because she had refused to marry him. In the
midst of all this Wesley writes: “I sat still at home, and, I
thank God, easy, having committed my cause to Him, and
remembering His word, ‘Blessed is the man that endureth
temptation; for when he is tried he shall receive the crown
of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love
Him.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Causton desired Mr. Burnside, the trustees’
secretary, to sign a certificate to the effect that Mrs. William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>son
had been for ten months past as constant a communicant
as any other, and that she had been of unblamable behaviour.
Mr. Burnside said he could not sign it with a safe conscience,
knowing it to be false. Upon which Causton severely reproached
him, and discharged him from his employment.
However, a number of names were procured to the certificate,
though, Wesley adds, the first part of it was shamefully
untrue, for Mrs. Williamson had omitted communicating
nine times in three months; in other words, had only communicated
once a month instead of once a week.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The Savannah court was to sit on August 22, a fortnight
after Wesley’s arrest; and Causton employed his utmost
power, and art, and application, in prejudicing the persons
who were to form the grand jury. His table was free to the
whole of them. Whatever they desired from the public stores
was delivered to them. Old misunderstandings were forgotten,
and nothing was too much to be done or promised
for men who, a week before, were unable, from such a source,
to procure even a crust of bread.</p>

<p>Six days previous to the opening of the court, Wesley,
at the request of several of his communicants, read a short
statement of the case, after the evening prayers, in the open
congregation.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>At length the great day of trial, in this Lilliputian kingdom,
came. The grand jury consisted of forty-four of the illustrious
inhabitants, about a fifth part of the adult male population
of Savannah. One was a Frenchman, ignorant of the English
language; one a papist; one a professed infidel; three were
Baptists; sixteen or seventeen others were Dissenters; and of
the rest, several had personal quarrels against Wesley, and
had openly vowed revenge.</p>

<p>Causton gave a long and earnest charge to the jury, “to
beware of spiritual tyranny, and to oppose the new, illegal
authority which was usurped over their consciences.” Mrs.
Williamson’s affidavit was read, the substance of which has
been already given, with the exception that, after her marriage,
Wesley took every opportunity to force upon her his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
private discourse, and terrified her by telling her that her
soul would be in danger, if she did not spend her time, and
converse with him, in the same manner, as she did before her
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Causton then delivered to the grand jury a paper, entitled
“A List of Grievances,” pretending to show that the Rev.
John Wesley “deviates from the principles and regulations of
the Established Church in many particulars inconsistent with
the happiness and prosperity of this colony,” as:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. By inverting the order and method of the liturgy.</p>

<p>“2. By altering such passages as he thinks proper in the version of the
psalms, publicly authorised to be sung in the church.</p>

<p>“3. By introducing into the church, and service at the altar, compositions
of psalms and hymns not inspected or authorised by any proper
judicature.</p>

<p>“4. By introducing novelties, such as dipping infants, etc., in the sacrament
of baptism, and refusing to baptize the children of such as will not
submit to his innovations.</p>

<p>“5. By restricting the benefits of the Lord’s supper to a small number
of persons, and refusing it to all others who will not conform to a grievous
set of penances, confessions, mortifications, and constant attendance at
early and late hours of prayer, very inconsistent with the labours and
employment of this colony.</p>

<p>“6. By administering the sacrament of the Lord’s supper to boys
ignorant and unqualified; and that notwithstanding of their parents and
nearest friends remonstrating against it, and accusing them of disobedience
and other crimes.</p>

<p>“7. By refusing to administer the holy sacrament to well disposed and
well living persons, unless they should submit to confessions and penances
for crimes, which they utterly refuse, and whereof no evidence is offered.</p>

<p>“8. By venting sundry uncharitable expressions of all who differ from
him; and not pronouncing the benediction in church, until all the hearers,
except his own communicants, are withdrawn.</p>

<p>“9. By teaching wives and servants that they ought absolutely to
follow the course of mortifications, fastings, and diets, and two sets of
prayers prescribed by him; without any regard to the interests of their
private families, or the commands of their respective husbands and
masters.</p>

<p>“10. By refusing the Office of the Dead to such as did not communicate
with him, or by leaving out such parts of the service as he thought proper.</p>

<p>“11. By searching into and meddling with the affairs of private families,
by means of servants and spies employed by him for the purpose, whereby
the peace both of public and private life is much endangered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>


<p>“12. By calling himself ‘ordinary,’ and thereby claiming a jurisdiction
which is not due to him, and whereby we should be precluded from
access to redress by any superior jurisdiction.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>
</div>

<p>How did the grand jury deal with these charges?</p>

<p>First of all, Mrs. Williamson was called, but acknowledged,
in the course of her examination, that she had no objection to
Wesley’s behaviour previous to her marriage. After her,
Mr. and Mrs. Causton were examined; the former confessing
that, if Wesley had asked his consent to marry his niece, he
would not have refused it.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Ten other witnesses were put
into the box, and several of Wesley’s letters to Mrs. Williamson
were read.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Some days were spent in sifting the business; and then,
on September 1, a majority of the jurymen agreed to the
following indictments:—</p>

<p>1. That, after the 12th of March last, the said John Wesley
did several times privately force his conversation to Sophia
Christiana Williamson, contrary to the express desire and
command of her husband; and did likewise write and privately
convey papers to her, thereby occasioning much uneasiness
between her and her husband.</p>

<p>2. That, on the 7th of August last, he refused the sacrament
of the Lord’s supper to Sophia Christiana Williamson,
without any apparent reason, much to the disquiet of her
mind, and to the great disgrace and hurt of her character.</p>

<p>3. That he hath not, since his arrival in Savannah, emitted
any public declaration of his adherence to the principles and
regulations of the Church of England.</p>

<p>4. That, for many months past, he has divided on the
Lord’s day the order of morning prayer, appointed to be used
in the Church of England, by only reading the said morning
prayer and the litany at five or six o’clock, and wholly
omitting the same between the hours of nine and eleven
o’clock, the customary time of public morning prayer.</p>

<p>5. That, about the month of April, 1736, he refused to
baptize, otherwise than by dipping, the child of Henry Parker,
unless the said Henry Parker and his wife would certify that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the child was weak and not able to bear dipping; and added
to his refusal, that, unless the said parents would consent to
have it dipped, it might die a heathen.</p>

<p>6. That, notwithstanding he administered the sacrament of
the Lord’s supper to William Gough, about the month of
March, 1736, he did, within a month after, refuse the sacrament
to the said William Gough, saying that he had heard that
William Gough was a Dissenter.</p>

<p>7. That in June, 1736, he refused reading the Office of the
Dead over the body of Nathaniel Polhill, only because
Nathaniel Polhill was not of his opinion; by means of which
refusal the said Nathaniel Polhill was interred without the
appointed Office for the Burial of the Dead.</p>

<p>8. That, on or about the 10th of August, 1737, he, in the
presence of Thomas Causton, presumptuously called himself
“Ordinary of Savannah,” assuming thereby an authority
which did not belong to him.</p>

<p>9. That in Whitsun-week last he refused William Aglionby
to stand godfather to the child of Henry Marley,
giving no other reason than that the said William Aglionby
had not been at the communion table with him.</p>

<p>10. That, about the month of July last, he baptized the
child of Thomas Jones, having only one godfather and godmother,
notwithstanding that Jacob Matthews did offer to
stand godfather.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Such were the findings of the majority of the grand jury.
The minority of twelve, including three constables and six
tithingmen, drew up and signed a document, and transmitted
it “to the honourable the trustees for Georgia,” to the following
effect:—</p>

<p>1. That they were thoroughly persuaded that the charges
against Mr. Wesley were an artifice of Mr. Causton’s, designed
rather to blacken the character of Mr. Wesley than to free the
colony from religious tyranny, as he had alleged.</p>

<p>2. That it did not appear that Mr. Wesley had either
spoken in private or written to Mrs. Williamson since the day
of her marriage, except one letter, which he wrote on the 5th
of July, at the request of her uncle, as a pastor, to exhort and
reprove her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>3. That, though he did refuse the sacrament to Mrs. Williamson
on the 7th of August last, he did not assume to himself
any authority contrary to law, for every person intending to
communicate was bound to signify his name to the curate, at
least some time the day before; which Mrs. Williamson did not
do; although Mr. Wesley had often, in full congregation, declared
he did insist on a compliance with that rubric, and had
before repelled divers persons for non-compliance therewith.</p>

<p>4. That, though he had not in Savannah emitted any public
declaration of his adherence to the principles and regulations
of the Church of England, he had done this, in a stronger
manner than by a formal declaration, by explaining and defending
the three creeds, the thirty-nine articles, the whole
Book of Common Prayer, and the homilies; besides a formal
declaration is not required, but from those who have received
institution and induction.</p>

<p>5. That though he had divided, on the Lord’s day, the order
of morning prayer, this was not contrary to any law in being.</p>

<p>6. That his refusal to baptize Henry Parker’s child, otherwise
than by dipping, was justified by the rubric.</p>

<p>7. That, though he had refused the sacrament to William
Gough, the said William Gough (one of the twelve jurors who
signed the document sent to the trustees) publicly declared
that the refusal was no grievance to him, because Mr. Wesley
had given him reasons with which he was satisfied.</p>

<p>8. That, in reference to the alleged refusal to read the
burial service over the body of Nathaniel Polhill, they had
good reason to believe that Mr. Wesley was at Frederica,
or on his return thence, when Polhill was interred; besides
Polhill was an anabaptist, and desired, in his lifetime, that he
might not be buried with the office of the Church of England.</p>

<p>9. That they were in doubt about the indictment concerning
Wesley calling himself “Ordinary of Savannah,” not well
knowing the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>10. That, though Mr. Wesley refused to allow William
Aglionby to stand godfather to the child of Henry Marley, and
Jacob Matthews to stand godfather to the child of Thomas
Jones, he was sufficiently justified by the canons of the Church,
because neither Aglionby nor Matthews had certified Mr.
Wesley that they had ever received the holy communion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Such were the findings of his foes and of his friends: the
only difference, as to fact, between the majority of thirty-two
and the minority of twelve, is that which relates to Mrs. Williamson
and Nathaniel Polhill. The minority declare that it
is not true that Mr. Wesley did <i>several times</i> privately force
his conversation to Sophia Williamson after her marriage; and
that they have good reason to believe that it is not true that
he refused to read the burial service over Nathaniel Polhill,
because, at the time of the burial, he was absent from Savannah.
All the other alleged facts are admitted, but are also justified.
How did Wesley meet the indictments?</p>

<p>On September 2, the day after they were presented and
were read to the people, he appeared in court, and spoke to
this effect:—“As to nine of the ten indictments against me, I
know this court can take no cognisance of them, they being
matters of an ecclesiastical nature. But that concerning my
speaking and writing to Mrs. Williamson is of a secular nature;
and this, therefore, I desire may be tried here where the facts
complained of were committed.”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>In this Wesley was unquestionably right. His conduct as
a priest of the Church of England might be, as it doubtless
was, arrogant, foolish, offensive, intolerant; but the petty
magisterial court at Savannah had no more right to try him
for his high church practices than an Old Bailey judge and
jury have to try the half-fledged papistical rectors, curates,
and incumbents, who are playing such fantastic tricks in the
Protestant churches of old England at the present day. They
had a right to try him on the matter mentioned by himself,
inasmuch as it was alleged that Mrs. Williamson had been injured
in her character, and, on that account, her husband
demanded damages to the extent of £1000.</p>

<p>Wesley was prepared to answer this indictment, and moved
for an immediate hearing; but the court evaded his request,
and postponed the hearing to its next sitting. From September
1, when the indictments were first presented, to the end
of November, when Wesley made known his intention to return
to England, he seems to have attended not fewer than
seven different sittings of the court, asking to be tried on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
charge affecting the character of Mrs. Williamson; but all
to no purpose. The fact is, Mr. and Mrs. Williamson, after
having stabbed him, were about to set sail to England,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and
their contemplated absence was made a pretext for not proceeding
with the trial. There can be little doubt that the
whole affair was as the twelve jurors believed, a device of
Thomas Causton, to gratify his spite, and, by annoyances, to
drive Wesley from the colony.</p>

<p>Six days after the majority of the grand jury presented their
indictments, Mr. Dixon, chaplain to a company of soldiers at
Frederica, called on Wesley, and informed him that the magistrates
of Savannah had given him authority to perform ecclesiastical
offices in the town; and that he should begin to do so
the day following, by reading prayers, preaching, and administering
the Lord’s supper. Accordingly, on September 8,
the bell was rung, and Mr. Dixon read prayers and preached,
in Wesley’s church, to Mr. Causton, Mr. and Mrs. Williamson,
and about half-a-score other persons. He announced that he
had intended to administer the holy communion, but some of
his communicants were indisposed. He would, however, read
prayers and preach every Thursday, and would administer
baptism to as many children as might be brought for that
purpose. This was <i>ipso facto</i> a setting aside of Wesley; or,
at all events, it was an arbitrary appointment of another
clergyman to fill his place.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following, September 11, Wesley preached
from, “It must needs be that offences come;” and then proceeded
to read a paper which he had read before, on the day
he began his ministry at Savannah, and in which he had
apprised his congregation:—1. That he must admonish every
one of them, not only in public, but from house to house. 2.
That he could admit none to the holy communion without
previous notice. 3. That he should divide the morning service
in compliance with the first design of the Church. 4. That he
should obey the rubric by dipping in baptism all children
who were well able to endure it. 5. That he should admit
none who were not communicants to be sureties in baptism.
6. That though, in general, he had all the authority which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
entrusted to any one within the province, yet he was only a
servant of the Church of England,—not a judge, and therefore
obliged to keep the regulations of that Church in all things.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>On succeeding Sundays, he read to the congregations the
homilies, and then began reading Dr. Rogers’s eight sermons,
as an antidote against the poison of infidelity. Up to the
present, he had no intention of leaving the colony. Indeed,
as lately as the 7th of June last, he had written to his sister
Keziah, and had made her an offer to come and live with him
at Savannah;<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> but, as soon as it was known that Williamson
and his wife were about to start for England, Delamotte
urged that Wesley ought to go as well, in order to prevent, or
remove, the misrepresentations which they were likely to make.
This was on September 9;<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and, a month later, Wesley took
counsel with his friends on the same subject. They were
unanimously of opinion “that he ought to go, but not yet;”
and accordingly he abandoned his purpose for the present.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he commenced three kinds of services which he
had not before attempted. He offered to read prayers, and
to expound the Scriptures, in French, every Saturday afternoon,
to the French families settled at Highgate, five miles
from Savannah, which offer was thankfully accepted. The
French at Savannah heard of this, and requested he would do
the same for them, with which request he willingly complied.
He also began to read prayers and expound in German, once
a week, to the German villagers of Hampstead.</p>

<p>His Sunday labour, during the few weeks that he yet remained
in Savannah, was as follows:—1. English prayers
from five o’clock to half-past six. 2. Italian prayers at nine.
3. A sermon and the holy communion, for the English, from
half-past ten to about half-past twelve. 4. The service for the
French at one, including prayers, psalms, and Scripture exposition.
5. The catechizing of the children at two. 6. The
third English service at three. 7. After this, a meeting in his
own house for reading, prayer, and praise. 8. At six, the
Moravian service began, which he was glad to attend, not to
teach, but learn.</p>

<p>Thus things proceeded until November 22, when Causton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
sent for Wesley and showed him an affidavit, sworn on September
15, to the effect that he had called Causton a liar and
a villain; but, with characteristic duplicity, said he had not
sent <i>this</i> affidavit to the trustees,—a statement, which, in fact,
was both true and false, for although he had not sent <i>this</i> affidavit
he had sent a <i>copy</i> of it. Causton bitterly added, that
the last court held in Savannah had reprimanded him as “an
enemy to and a hinderer of the public peace.” “Both,” says
an eye-witness, “displayed warmth of temper; but Causton
was most vehement. They parted with mutual civilities.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>This caused Wesley to again consult his friends about the
propriety of his leaving the colony. He saw that at present
there was no possibility of instructing the Indians; neither had
he as yet found or heard of any Indians who had the least
desire of being instructed. Thus the great reason of his leaving
England was not realised. Then, as to Savannah, he had
never engaged himself, either by word or letter, to stay there
a day longer than he should judge convenient. And, further,
he now saw a probability of doing more service to the unhappy
colonists by going to England, than he could do by remaining
in Georgia; for there he could, without fear or favour, report to
the trustees the state in which the colony was placed. All his
friends agreed with him; and accordingly, next morning, he
called on Causton, and told him he “designed to set out for
England immediately, and placarded an advertisement in the
great square” of the unbuilt town to the same effect.</p>

<p>Savannah was in great excitement. Causton had his partisans,
and so had Wesley his. Scandal was plentiful. Wesley’s
congregations dwindled, and were now extremely thin. Mr.
Stephens, the secretary of the trustees at Savannah, relates<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
that, in November, he heard Wesley preach on “Is it lawful
to give tribute unto Cæsar or not?” from which he discoursed
largely on the duties of magistrates, and on the obedience
which was due to them; setting forth how far it was consistent
with Christian liberty for people to insist upon their
rights, when they found themselves oppressed by inferior
magistrates exercising a discretionary authority which ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>ceeded
their commission. Stephens adds, that the congregation
was very poor, and that he found that the magistrates
and many of the principal inhabitants had of late wholly
absented themselves from church.</p>

<p>On November 20, Wesley preached from the text, “Jesus
wept.” Stephens writes: “He showed himself a good casuist;
but his metaphysical discourse would have been better adapted
to a learned audience than such a poor thin congregation as
his, who stood in need of plain doctrine.”</p>

<p>On November 27, he preached from Acts xx. 26, 27. Stephens,
who was present, says: “He enforced the practice of all
Christian duties most pathetically, which he was well qualified
to do. Some people imagined, from the choice of the text,
that he meant it as a sort of farewell sermon; but it did not
appear so from any particular expressions employed.”</p>

<p>No sooner was it known that Wesley meant to embark for
England, than Williamson issued an advertisement that he
had brought an action against him for £1000 damages; and
that if any one assisted his escape from the colony, he would
prosecute such accomplice with the utmost rigour of the law.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
The magistrates also sent for Wesley, and told him he must
not leave the province till he had answered the indictments
against him. Wesley replied that he had already attended
seven sessions of the court to answer them, and had not
been permitted. They then requested him to sign a kind of
bond, engaging him, under a penalty of £50, to appear at
their court when he should be required; and added that Mr.
Williamson also demanded that he should give bail to answer
his action. Wesley replied that he would give neither any
bond, nor any bail at all; and so he left them. In the afternoon
of the same day they published an order requiring all
the officers and sentinels to prevent his leaving the province,
and forbidding any person to assist him in doing so.</p>

<p>He was now a prisoner at large, and the same evening, after
public prayers, he set out in a boat for Purrysburg, distant about
twenty miles, and thus left Savannah and Georgia for ever.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Arriving at Purrysburg early in the morning of December 3,
Wesley and the four men who had assisted in his escape,
and had rowed him to Purrysburg, set out on foot to
Port Royal. Tramping their way through trackless forests,
they came to a large swamp, around which they wandered for
three weary hours. Then they had to force their way through
an almost impassable thicket. They had now been trudging
from an hour before sunrise in the morning till nearly sunset
at night, and had not tasted food, except a gingerbread cake,
which Wesley happened to have in his pocket. They were
faint and weary, and no wonder. Thrusting a stick into the
ground, and finding its end moist, two of them set to work
digging with their hands, and, at about three feet depth, obtained
water. They thanked God, drank, and were refreshed.
The month was December, and the night cold; but there was
no complaining; and, having commended themselves to God,
they lay down on the ground, close together, and Wesley, at
least, slept till near six in the morning.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday; but the bewildered fugitives
started again, and after three more days of weary wandering
reached Port Royal. Delamotte joined them on Thursday,
December 8, when, taking a boat, they all set sail for Charlestown.
This was no comfortable steamer, but a small watercraft,
without covering, and impelled by oars. Four days
were spent in making the passage, the winds were contrary,
and their provisions short; but, cold and hungry, they arrived
in safety on Tuesday, December 13.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Wesley and Delamotte, with the exception of a few brief
days, had not been parted for the last six-and-twenty months:
but on December 22 the former set sail for England; the
latter, for a season, was left behind. One of Wesley’s fellow
passengers was a young gentleman, who had been one of his
parishioners at Savannah; and another was Eleanor Hayes,
who became one of the first Methodists in London, and of
whom an interesting notice may be found in the <i>Methodist
Magazine</i> for 1867. It was impossible for Wesley to live
an idle life. During the voyage, he began instructing two
negro lads and the cabin-boy in the principles of the Christian
religion. On Sundays, at least, he had morning and evening
prayers. He finished his abridgment of De Renty’s Life;
and he read and explained to a poor Frenchman a chapter in
the New Testament every morning. When in mid-ocean they
encountered a terrific storm, which gave Wesley an opportunity
of speaking faithfully to all on board about their eternal interests.
On February 1 they landed at Deal, the day after
George Whitefield had set sail for the very settlement which
Wesley had been obliged to leave.</p>

<p>During the passage Wesley had ample time for self-examination,
and wrote as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By the most infallible of proofs, inward feeling, I am convinced—</p>

<p>“1. Of unbelief; having no such faith in Christ as will prevent my heart
being troubled.</p>

<p>“2. Of pride, throughout my life past; inasmuch as I thought I had
what I find I have not.</p>

<p>“3. Of gross irrecollection; inasmuch as in a storm I cry to God every
moment, in a calm not.</p>

<p>“4. Of levity and luxuriancy of spirit; appearing by my speaking
words not tending to edify, but most by my manner of speaking of my
enemies.”</p>
</div>

<p>He adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I went to America to convert the Indians; but oh, who shall convert
me? I have a fair summer religion. I can talk well; but let death look
me in the face, and my spirit is troubled. I think, verily, if the gospel be
true, I am safe: for I not only have given, and do give, all my goods
to feed the poor; and not only give my body to be burned, drowned, or
whatever God shall appoint for me; but I follow after charity, if haply I
may attain it. I now believe the gospel is true. I show my faith by my
works,—by staking my all upon it. I would do so again and again,
a thousand times, if the choice were still to make. Whoever sees me sees
I would be a Christian. But in a storm, I think, ‘What if the gospel be not
true? Then thou art of all men most foolish. For what hast thou given
thy goods, thy ease, thy friends, thy reputation, thy country, thy life? For
what art thou wandering over the face of the earth—a dream! a cunningly
devised fable?’ Oh, who will deliver me from this fear of death?
A wise man advised me some time since, ‘Be still and go on.’ Perhaps
this is best, to look upon it as my cross.”</p>
</div>

<p>After landing in England, he penned another remarkable
paper, which has often been cited without a quotation
of the notes he appended in after years.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He asserts that
when he went to America, to convert the Indians, he was not
himself converted; but in the appended note he adds, “I am
not sure of this.” Neither are we. By his conscientious
severity in comparing himself with the standard of a perfect
Christian, as contained in the New Testament, and by his
imperfect and mystified views of the scriptural plan of salvation,
he might deprive himself of the filial confidence and joy
belonging to a child of God; but we dare not affirm that he
was a child of wrath because he was without the joy. On the
same principle, thousands of us would be children one day, but
not the next. Wesley’s assertion was too strong; in after life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
he felt it so; and those who quote it ought, in all fairness, to
add what he himself appended.</p>

<p>In another part of the same document he says of himself:
“Alienated as I am from the life of God, I am a child of
wrath, an heir of hell.” But the note he attached to this, in
subsequent years, is, “I believe not”; and if not a child
of wrath, then in his opinion, and after mature reflection, he
had a right to think himself a child of grace and an heir of
heaven.</p>

<p>Another of his notes is: “I had even then the faith of a
servant, though not that of a son;” and that the reader may
know what interpretation to put upon such words, we give
the following extract from one of Wesley’s own sermons:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But what is the faith which is properly saving? It is such a Divine
conviction of God, and the things of God, as, even in its infant state,
enables every one that possesses it to fear God and work righteousness.
And whosoever, in every nation, believes thus far, is accepted of Him.
He actually is, at that very moment, in a state of acceptance. But he is
at present only a <i>servant</i> of God, not properly a <i>son</i>. Meanwhile let it
be well observed that the wrath of God no longer abideth on him.
Nearly fifty years ago, when the preachers, commonly called Methodists,
began to preach that grand scriptural doctrine, salvation by faith, they
were not sufficiently apprised of the difference between a servant and a
child of God. In consequence of this, they were apt to make sad the
hearts of those whom God had not made sad. For they frequently asked
those who feared God, ‘Do you know that your sins are forgiven?’ And
upon their answering ‘No,’ immediately replied, ‘Then you are a child
of the devil.’ No; that does not follow. It might have been said (and
it is all that can be said with propriety), ‘Hitherto you are only a <i>servant</i>,
you are not a <i>child</i> of God. You have already great reason to praise
God that He has called you to His honourable service. Fear not, continue
crying unto Him, and you shall see greater things than these!’ And,
indeed, unless the servants of God halt by the way, they will receive the
adoption of sons. They will receive the <i>faith</i> of the children of God, by
His <i>revealing</i> His only begotten Son in their hearts. Thus, the faith of a
child is, properly and directly, a Divine conviction, whereby every child of
God is enabled to testify, ‘The life that I now live I live by faith in the
Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.’ And whosoever
hath this, the Spirit of God witnesseth with his spirit, that he is a child of
God. This then it is, that properly constitutes the difference between a
servant of God and a child of God.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>Let those who have been accustomed to cite Wesley’s
hasty and incautious condemnation of himself, on his return
from Georgia, read it again in the light of his own appended
notes, and in the light of this extract from a sermon written
by himself nearly fifty years afterwards; and they will then
have a more correct idea of Wesley’s religious state at Oxford
and in America, and will also be better fitted to understand
what is meant by what is called his conversion on the
24th of May, 1738. This matter, however, must be resumed
in its proper place.</p>

<p>Wesley, in Georgia, was accepted of God through Christ;
but, to cite his own words at the conclusion of his own
condemnatory document, he wanted “a sure trust and confidence
in God, that, through the merits of Christ, his sins
were forgiven.” “I want,” says he, “that faith which none
can have without knowing that he hath it.”</p>

<p>Wesley, according to his own explanation, had long been
in a <i>saved</i> state (though he knew it not); but he was far from
being perfect, either in spirit or behaviour. No man could be
more sincere or earnest; but it is hoped that few ministers of
equal learning, wisdom, and sanctity make greater blunders
than were made by him at Savannah. There can be little
doubt that he had ecclesiastical authority for most, if not all,
his priestly practices; and so have the half papistical priests
and ritualists of the present day. But as England now is
right in resisting the introduction of rites and ceremonies,
fasts and feasts, confessions and penances, absolutions and
interdicts, savouring more of the man of sin than of the
word of God,—so Savannah then was right in resisting
similar innovations attempted to be introduced by the extremely
high church priest, fresh from the society of the
Oxford Methodists. If we are right in denouncing <i>ritualism</i>
now, Savannah was right in denouncing <i>ritualism</i> then. If
the thing is offensive and obnoxious here, it was equally offensive
and obnoxious there; and if no other end had been
answered by Wesley’s mission to America than knocking out
of him his high church nonsense, the good effected would have
been an ample compensation for two dangerous voyages of six
thousand miles, and for all the discomforts of living two-and-twenty
months, in a log-built hut, among almost homeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
emigrants, who had taken with them to the swamps and
woods of Georgia more covetousness than courtesy, more
rudeness than rank, more quarrelsomeness than quietude, and
more conceit than common sense.</p>

<p>Wesley has been blamed for repelling Mrs. Williamson
from the communion; and if he had nothing more to allege
against her than the offence that, since her marriage, she had
come to sacrament once a month only, instead of once a week,
he deserves to be blamed. It was a rash proceeding, utterly
unwarranted; and both she and her husband did right in
resisting it. So far we agree with Wesley’s censors; but we
cannot agree with them in saying that the great, if not only,
reason of his repelling her was revenge arising out of her
refusal to marry him. There is not a particle of evidence in
proof of that. Five months had elapsed since her marriage;
and, again and again, during that interval, he had administered
to her the holy communion. The repulse was, on his part,
a strictly conscientious, not a revengeful act; but though
conscientious, it was, to say the least, mistaken, and deserves
censure instead of praise. Mr. Moore says that, about three
months after Mrs. Williamson’s marriage, Wesley saw things
in her conduct which induced him to bless God for his deliverance
in not marrying her, and that these things were
noted in his private journal never printed. We have not the
slightest wish to defend the lady where she deserves censure:
but fairness compels us to say that we have seen the private
journal; but neither in it, nor elsewhere, have we met with
anything charged against her more serious than what has
been already mentioned in the present far too lengthy chapter.
Dissimulation is the strongest word Wesley has used concerning
her; and this is used in reference to something which
happened three months after she was married, and of which
no explanation is given.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Miss Hopkey, like Wesley himself,
was not so good as she might have been; but that is not a
sufficient reason why Wesley’s biographers should insinuate,
if not assert, that she was worse than she really was.</p>

<p>Wesley’s mission to America seemed a failure! But was
it so? When Whitefield arrived, he wrote: “The good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Mr. John Wesley has done in America is inexpressible. His
name is very precious among the people; and he has laid a
foundation that I hope neither men nor devils will ever be
able to shake. Oh that I may follow him as he has followed
Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Wesley himself observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many reasons I have to bless God for my having been carried to
America, contrary to all my preceding resolutions. Hereby, I trust, He
hath in some measure ‘<i>humbled me and proved me, and shown me what
was in my heart</i>.’ Hereby, I have been taught to ‘<i>beware of men</i>.’
Hereby, God has given me to know many of His servants, particularly
those of the church of Herrnhuth. Hereby, my passage is open to the
writings of holy men, in the German, Spanish, and Italian tongues. All
in Georgia have heard the word of God, and some have believed and
begun to run well. A few steps have been taken towards publishing the glad
tidings both to the African and American heathens. Many children have
learned how they ought to serve God, and to be useful to their neighbour.
And those whom it most concerns have an opportunity of knowing the
state of their infant colony, and laying a firmer foundation of peace and
happiness to many generations.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These are no mean results to be realised in about two
years,—self-knowledge, caution, acquaintance with the church
that was to help him to clearer views of the plan of salvation,
the acquisition of three European languages, the unprecedented
fact of preaching Christ to <i>all</i> the widely scattered inhabitants
of an English colony, steps taken to evangelise negroes and
Indians, many children religiously educated, and the way
prepared for promoting the prosperity of Georgia to the end
of time!</p>

<small><i>WESLEY IN TRANSITION.</i> 1738.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1738<br />

Age 35</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHITEFIELD left England the day before Wesley
reached it. He landed in Georgia on the 7th of May,
1738, and remained sixteen weeks; and then set out again for
his own country, where he arrived on November 30. A flying
visit, but not a fruitless one. Having been ordained by Bishop
Benson in June, 1736, he began his unparalleled preaching
career with a sermon in the church of St. Mary de Crypt,
Gloucester, where he had been baptized, and where he first
received the sacrament of the Lord’s supper. Some of his
congregation mocked, but most were powerfully impressed.
The bishop was informed that the sermon had driven fifteen
persons mad; the worthy prelate hoped the madness would
be abiding. Whitefield was a stripling of twenty-one; but
wherever he went crowds flocked to hear him. At Bristol,
the whole city seemed alarmed; Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians,
and sectarians of all kinds, ran after him; and
churches were as full on week days as they had used to be on
Sundays. Wesley wrote to his Oxford friends, asking help
for Georgia. Whitefield was preaching as often as four times
a day, and had become so famous that Raikes, of Gloucester,
and others, thought it an enrichment of their newspapers
to insert accounts of his doings; but his friend
Wesley needed help, and that was quite enough to make him
treat as trifles the praises of the multitudes who ran after him.
Just at the time when Wesley was compelled to leave Georgia,
Whitefield repaired to London to embark for it. During his
brief detention, in less than three months, he preached in London
above a hundred sermons, and collected above a thousand
pounds for charity schools and for the poor. When he set sail,
he read prayers and preached twice every day; and such was
his influence on board, that the very soldiers stood out before
him to say their catechism like little children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>The day after his arrival at Savannah, Causton and the
magistrates sent word that they would wait upon him; but
he chose rather to wait upon them, and was treated with as
much deference as Wesley had been treated with disrespect.
He began to visit from house to house, catechized, read
prayers morning and evening, and expounded the two second
lessons every day. He found Tomo-Chichi, the Indian chief,
on a blanket, thin and meagre, and evidently dying. At
Hampstead and Highgate he followed Wesley’s example, and
read prayers once a week, though the population of the former
village consisted of only three men, one woman, and seven
children. He also visited Thunderbolt, a village of three
families consisting of sixteen persons, and preached to them.
He likewise opened a girls’ school at Savannah. He paid a
few days’ visit to Frederica, where there was now a population
of about one hundred and twenty; and read prayers and
preached, under a large tree, to more than could have been
expected. He also visited the Saltzburghers at Ebenezer,
and found two such pious ministers as he had not often seen.</p>

<p>Four months having been thus spent, he set out for England,
the Savannah people bidding adieu to him with tearful eyes,
and begging that he would soon return. He landed in Ireland
in November, where mayors and bishops vied with each other
in inviting him to their mansions and palaces, and where he
also took the opportunity of visiting the cabins of Irish
peasants, in one of which, twenty feet long and twelve broad,
there were a man, his wife and three children, two pigs feeding,
two dogs, and several geese, a great fire, and the master of
the family threshing corn.</p>

<p>On reaching London, he found that those who had been
awakened by his preaching a year ago had “grown strong
men in Christ, by the ministrations of his dear friends and
fellow labourers, John and Charles Wesley.” The old doctrine
of justification by faith only had been much revived; societies
had been instituted at Fetter Lane and other places; and
Whitefield ended the eventful year of 1738 by preaching and
expounding, during the last week of it, not fewer than seven-and-twenty
times.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>Let us now turn to Wesley. He landed at Deal early in
the morning of February 1; and at once resumed his work in
England, by reading prayers and preaching at the inn. After
breakfast, he set out for London, and, reaching Faversham at
night, he again read prayers and expounded the second lesson
to a few who were called Christians, but who were more savage
in their behaviour than the wildest Indians he had ever met.
His next halting place was Blendon, where the family of his
friend Charles Delamotte gave him a hearty welcome. On
the evening of February 3, he arrived in London; and, without
delay, visited Oglethorpe, and waited upon the Georgian
trustees; gave to them a written account why he had left the
colony; and returned to them the instrument whereby they
had appointed him minister of Savannah.</p>

<p>Wesley was too earnest to take a holiday. Time with him
was too important for any part of it to be spent in idleness.
Reaching London on Friday, he resumed preaching on Sunday;
and, for the next fifty-three years, never ceased, and never
lagged, in this important work, except when serious sickness
occasionally laid upon him a brief embargo.</p>

<p>And, certainly, if England ever needed earnest, enthusiastic
labourers, it was now. During this very year of 1738, not
fewer than fifty-two criminals were hanged at Tyburn; and
within the last two years about 12,000 persons had been convicted,
within the Bills of Mortality, of smuggling gin, or of
selling it without the £50 per annum licence. Sunday traffic
had become such a nuisance in London and its suburbs, that
even the court of aldermen interfered, and commanded the
marshals, and all constables, beadles, and other public officers,
to use their best endeavours to suppress it. They were also to
apprehend all shoeblacks cleaning shoes in the public streets;
and to take notice of all vintners, ale and coffee house keepers,
barbers, and others, who exercised their ordinary trades on
Sundays. A committee of the House of Lords “to examine
into the causes of the present notorious immorality and profaneness,”
stated, in their report, that they had sufficient
grounds to believe that a number of loose and disorderly
persons had of late formed themselves into a club, under the
name of <i>Blasters</i>, and were using means to induce the youth of
the kingdom to join them. The members of this impious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
club professed themselves to be votaries of the devil, offered
prayers to him, and drank his health. They also had been
heard to utter “the most daring and execrable blasphemies
against the sacred name and majesty of God; and to use such
obscene, blasphemous, and before unheard of expressions as the
Lords’ committee think they cannot even mention, and therefore
they pass them over in silence.” The same committee
further reported, that “of late years there had appeared a
greater neglect of religion and of all things sacred—a greater
neglect of Divine worship, both public and private, and of
the due observance of the sabbath, than had ever before been
known in England. There was a want of reverence to the
laws and to magistrates, and of a due subordination in the
several ranks and degrees of the community. There was an
abuse of liberty, a great neglect in education, and a want of
care in training children, and in keeping servants in good order;
while idleness, luxury, gambling, and an excessive use of
spirituous and intoxicating liquors had grown into an alarming
magnitude.” The report concludes by recommending that
the bishops be desired, at their visitations, to particularly charge
the clergy to exhort the people to a more frequent and constant
attendance at Divine services; and that visitors of the
universities and of schools require the fellows and masters carefully
to instruct the youth committed to their care, in the principles
of religion and morality; to which recommendation the
House of Lords agreed.</p>

<p>One month, in 1738, was spent by Wesley in his homeward
voyage from America. Three others were spent in Germany.
During the remaining eight he preached in various parts of
England, at least, eighty times. One of his sermons was
delivered in the cabin of a ship, two were preached in workhouses,
eleven in Oxford castle, one in Oxford Bocardo,
one in Lincoln College chapel, one in Manchester, one at
Windsor, one at Stanton-Harcourt, two in Newgate prison,
and the remainder principally in twenty-six different churches
in the metropolis. His sermon at St. John the Evangelist’s
“offended many of the best in the parish.” His first discourse
at St. Lawrence’s was “an open defiance of that
mystery of iniquity which the world calls ‘prudence,’” and
gave great offence. A sermon at Oxford castle was chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
addressed to a man condemned to die, and who, on the same
day, found the forgiveness of his sins, and shortly after went to
the gallows “enjoying perfect peace.” At one of his sermons
in Newgate prison, nine persons were present who had recently
received sentence of death—two for murdering their wives,
one for filing guineas, two for burglary, and four for robberies.
These wretched creatures, and two others previously condemned,
were all executed at Tyburn, on November 8;<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and,
at their earnest desire, Wesley and his brother, on the day of
execution, went to Newgate “to do the last good office” to
them. Charles preached; the malefactors wept; and some of
them, at least, were filled with “the peace of God which passeth
all understanding.” Wesley writes: “It was the most glorious
instance I ever saw of faith triumphing over sin and death.”</p>

<p>The great event in Wesley’s history, during the year 1738,
was his conversion. Something has been said already on this
momentous subject; but other facts and explanations must
now be given. Let us try to answer the questions following:—</p>

<p>1. What was the religious state, and what were the religious
views, of Wesley previous to his conversion? 2. What were
the doctrines he was taught by Peter Bohler? 3. When was
he converted? and how?</p>

<p>1. Wesley’s religious state and views previous to his conversion.</p>

<p>He was <i>almost a Christian</i>.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> He most rigorously abstained
from everything which the gospel of Christ prohibits, and
cheerfully practised everything which it enjoins. He avoided
every form of profanity, and every word or look that, directly
or indirectly, tended to uncleanness. He equally avoided
detraction, backbiting, talebearing, evil speaking, and idle
words. He was no railer, brawler, or scoffer at the faults
or infirmities of others, but continually endeavoured to live
peaceably with all men. He laboured and suffered for the
benefit of many. He reproved the wicked, instructed the
ignorant, confirmed the wavering, quickened the good, and
comforted the afflicted. He used all the means of grace, and
at all opportunities: he attended public service every day;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
he communicated every week; he constantly used family
prayer; he had set times daily for private devotions. All this
was done from a sincere and hearty desire to serve God and to
do His will. In all his conversation and in all his actions—in
all he did and in all he left undone, his only motive was a
design to please and honour God. He declares that he went
thus far for many years, and yet that all this time he was
only <i>almost a Christian</i>.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>He held no principles but what he believed to be revealed
in the word of God; and, in the interpretation of that word
he always judged the most literal sense to be the best, unless
when the literal sense of one scripture contradicted some other.
He firmly believed in a change wrought in the heart by the
Holy Spirit, and called a person thus changed “regenerated,
born again, and a new creature.” In all other cases, he endeavoured
to express spiritual things in spiritual words, though
he was not ignorant that such words and their hidden meaning
were treated by the unconverted as jargon and cant.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>He had many remarkable answers to prayer, especially
when he was in trouble; and he had many sensible comforts—short
anticipations of the life of faith. He had a Divine
conviction of God and of the things of God; and firmly
believed in Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the world.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He
was, at least, a <i>servant</i> of God, <i>and was accepted of Him</i>;<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and
yet all this while he was beating the air, and was seeking to
establish his own righteousness, instead of submitting to the
righteousness of Christ which is by faith. He delighted in
the law of God, after the inner man; and yet he was carnal,
sold under sin. Every day he was constrained to cry out,
“What I do I allow not: for what I would I do not; but
what I hate that I do. To will is present with me; but how
to perform that which is good, I find not.” He was fighting
with sin continually, but not always conquering. Before, he
had <i>willingly</i> served sin; now it was <i>unwillingly</i>; but still he
served it. He fell, and rose, and fell again. Sometimes he
was overcome, and in heaviness; sometimes he overcame, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
was in joy. Once he had foretastes of the terrors of the law;
but now he had foretastes of the comforts of the gospel. For
above ten years there was in him this struggle between nature
and grace; and yet he was still only striving with, not freed
from, sin; neither had he the witness of the Spirit with his
spirit that he was a child of God; nor indeed could he, for he
“sought it not by faith, but, as it were, by the works of the
law.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Such is Wesley’s description of himself; and this, when
added to what has been previously said concerning his religious
career at Oxford, will be a sufficient answer to the
first of the three questions proposed.</p>

<p>2. The second is, what were the doctrines which Wesley
was taught by Peter Bohler?</p>

<p>In the storm which Wesley encountered in his voyage from
Georgia, he found himself in fear of death; and was convinced
that the cause of it was unbelief; and that the gaining a true
living faith was the “one thing needful” for him.</p>

<p>Peter Bohler told him that true faith in Christ was inseparably
attended by—(1) dominion over sin; and (2) constant
peace, arising from a sense of forgiveness. Wesley was amazed,
and regarded this as a new gospel; for if this was so, it was
clear that he was without true faith in Christ, because he was
without its inseparable fruits. He was not willing to be
convinced of this. He disputed with all his strength, and
laboured to prove that there might be faith without the two
fruits mentioned, and especially the second. Bohler referred
him to the Bible and to experience. Wesley consulted the
Bible, and when he had set aside the glosses of men he was
bound to acknowledge that Bohler was correct. Still he hesitated
to believe that any “experience” could be adduced in
favour of Bohler’s doctrine. The next day Bohler brought to
him three persons, all of whom testified of their own personal
experience that a true living faith in Christ is inseparable from
a sense of pardon for all past, and freedom from all present,
sins. They also added, with one mouth, that this faith is the
gift, the free gift of God; and that He will surely give it to
every one who earnestly and perseveringly prays for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>At subsequent interviews with Bohler, another doctrine was
forced on Wesley, namely, that this saving faith in Christ is
given in a moment; and that in an instant a man is turned
from sin and misery to righteousness and joy in the Holy
Ghost. Wesley kicked against this also; and Bohler again
referred him to the Scriptures and to experience. Wesley
searched the Scriptures; and, to his utter astonishment, he
found there were scarcely any instances of other than <i>instantaneous</i>
conversions. Still he had one retreat left, and told
Bohler that, though “God wrought thus in the first ages of
Christianity, times now were changed.” To meet this objection,
Bohler, the day after, turned to his <i>experience</i> test, and
brought to Wesley several living witnesses, who testified that
God had given them, in a moment, such a faith in Christ as
translated them out of darkness into light, out of sin and fear
into holiness and happiness. Wesley writes: “Here ended
my disputing. I could now only cry out, ‘Lord, help Thou
my unbelief.’ I was now thoroughly convinced; and, by
the grace of God, I resolved to seek this faith unto the end—(1)
By absolutely renouncing all dependence, in whole or in
part, upon my own works of righteousness; on which I had
really grounded my hope of salvation, though I knew it not,
from my youth up. (2) By adding to the constant use of all
the other means of grace continual prayer for this very thing—justifying,
saving faith, a full reliance on the blood of Christ
shed for me; a trust in Him as my Christ, as my sole justification,
sanctification, and redemption.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>These then were the great doctrines which Peter Bohler
brought to the hearing of John Wesley. They were new
to him; but finding them to be scriptural, and also corroborated
by living experience, he at once believed them. He
went to the Delamotte family at Blendon, and there spake
clearly and fully concerning them. Mr. Broughton and his
brother Charles were present. The former objected, and the
latter became so much offended, that in anger he left the room,
telling his brother that his newfangled doctrines were mischievous.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
Wesley also wrote to his brother Samuel on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
same subject, on the 4th of April, declaring that he had seen,
so far as it could be seen, very many persons changed, in a
moment, from the spirit of horror, fear, and despair, to the
spirit of hope, joy, and peace; and from sinful desires, till
then reigning over them, to a pure desire of doing the will of
God.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>We proceed to the third question,—</p>

<p>3. When and how was Wesley converted? His first interview
with Bohler was on February 7, 1738; and, from that
time till the 4th of May, when Bohler left London for Carolina,
he embraced every opportunity of conversing with him.
They went in company to Oxford, and to Mr. Gambold, at
Stanton-Harcourt. The man of erudition, and of almost
anchorite piety, sat at the feet of this godly German like a
little child, and was content to be thought a fool that he
might be wise. “My brother, my brother,” said Bohler,
“that philosophy of yours must be purged away;” and purged
away it was. Wesley thought that, being without faith, he
ought to leave off preaching. But Bohler replied: “By no
means. Preach faith till you have it; and then, because you
have it, you will preach it;” and, on the 6th of March, he
began to preach accordingly. Meanwhile several of his friends,
as his brother Charles, Mr. Gambold, and Mr. Stonehouse,
vicar of Islington, had embraced the doctrine of salvation by
faith only; and two, Whitefield, and Mr. Hutchins, of Pembroke
College, had experienced it.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Charles Wesley also, on
Whit-Sunday, May 21, was made a partaker of the same great
blessing. At the time, he was ill of pleurisy, and his brother
and some other friends came to him, and sang a hymn of
praise to the Holy Ghost; and, after they were gone, he was
enabled to exercise that faith in Christ of the want of which
he had been recently convinced, and was filled with love and
peace. Wesley himself was still a mourner. His heart was
heavy. He felt that there was no good in him; and that all
his works, his righteousness, and his prayers, so far from
having merit, needed an atonement for themselves. His
mouth was stopped. He knew that he deserved nothing but
wrath; and yet he heard a voice, saying, “Believe, and thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
shalt be saved;” “he that believeth is passed from death unto
life.” Three more days of anguish were thus passed; and
then, on May 24, at five in the morning, he opened his
Testament on these words: “There are given unto us exceeding
great and precious promises, that by these ye might be
partakers of the Divine nature.” On leaving home, he opened
on the text, “Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.”
In the afternoon, he went to St. Paul’s Cathedral, where
the anthem was full of comfort. At night, he went to a
society-meeting in Aldersgate Street, where a person read
Luther’s preface to the epistle to the Romans, in which
Luther teaches what faith is, and also that faith alone justifies.
Possessed of it, the heart is “cheered, elevated, excited,
and transported with sweet affections towards God.”
Receiving the Holy Ghost, through faith, the man “is renewed
and made spiritual,” and he is impelled to fulfil the
law “by the vital energy in himself.” While this preface
was being read, Wesley experienced an amazing change.
He writes: “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did
trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance
was given me, that He had taken away my sins, even mine,
and saved me from the law of sin and death; and I then
testified openly to all there, what I now first felt in my
heart.” Towards ten o’clock, a troop of friends took him to
his brother; they sang a hymn with joy; and then parted
with a prayer.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>To add to this would be folly. The questions proposed
have been answered from Wesley’s own writings. For ten
years he had believed in Christ, but never believed as he did
now. He had been intensely pious; but now he possessed
power over himself and sin which he had not possessed before.
He had practised religion; but now he experienced its bliss.
According to his own sermon, written nearly half a century
subsequent to this, he was, as a <i>servant</i> of God, <i>accepted</i>, and
was <i>safe</i>; but now he <i>knew</i> it, and was <i>happy</i> as well as <i>safe</i>.
There was sunshine in his soul, which lit up his face, and which
turned the severe ascetic, for a season at least, into a joyful
saint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Having given, as briefly and as clearly as we can, an account
of the way in which Wesley, after ten years of earnest
prayer, rigorous fasting, and self-sacrificing piety, was brought
into the blissful enjoyment of a conscious salvation, this may
be a fitting place to notice the man, by whose instrumentality
he was taught the nature and fruits of saving faith.</p>

<p>Peter Bohler was born at Frankfort, on the last day of
the year 1712. He was educated in the university of Jena,
where he also studied theology. When sixteen years of age,
he joined the Moravians; and when twenty-five, he was ordained
for the work of the ministry by Count Zinzendorf, this being
the first time that the count exercised his episcopal functions.
Immediately after his ordination, Bohler set out for London,
on his way to Carolina; and here it was that Wesley first met
him. Wesley introduced him to James Hutton, and procured
him lodgings. Charles Wesley began to teach him English;
and a tailor, of the name of Viney, interpreted his Latin
addresses in the Moravian meetings. Questions were asked
him, and he simply answered them from the Holy Scriptures.
His exposition of saving faith was new, even to the London
Moravians; and, “to their astonishment, they saw, for the
first time, that he who believeth in Jesus hath everlasting life;
and it was with indescribable joy that they embraced the
doctrine of justification through faith in Christ, and of freedom
by it from the dominion and guilt of sin.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Marvellous
blessings attended Bohler’s interpreted discourses; and a
work was begun, says Wesley, “such as will never come to
an end, till heaven and earth pass away.”</p>

<p>“I travelled,” writes Bohler to Zinzendorf, “with the two
brothers, John and Charles Wesley, from London to Oxford.
The elder, John, is a good-natured man: he knew he did not
properly believe on the Saviour, and was willing to be taught.
His brother, with whom you often conversed a year ago, is at
present very much distressed in his mind, but does not know
how he shall begin to be acquainted with the Saviour. Our
mode of believing in the Saviour is so easy to Englishmen,
that they cannot reconcile themselves to it; if it were a little
more artful, they would much sooner find their way into it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Of faith in Jesus they have no other idea than the generality
of people have. They justify themselves; and, therefore, they
always take it for granted, that they believe already, and try
to prove their faith by their works, and thus so plague and
torment themselves that they are at heart very miserable.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>These are weighty words on the simplicity of saving faith,
and well deserve pondering by both the ministers and members
of the church at the present day.</p>

<p>Wesley had found peace with God; but, for the encouragement
of new converts, let it be remembered that his joy in
the Holy Ghost was not unbroken. The same night, he “was
much buffeted with temptations, which returned again and
again.” The day after, “the enemy injected a fear” that the
change was not great enough, and therefore that his faith was
not real. On May 26, his “soul continued in peace, but yet
in heaviness because of manifold temptations.” On the 27th,
there was a want of joy, which led him to resolve to spend
the time of every morning, until he went to church, in unceasing
prayer. On the 31st, he “grieved the Spirit of God,
not only by not watching unto prayer, but likewise by speaking
with sharpness, instead of tender love, of one who was not
sound in the faith. Immediately God hid His face, and he
was troubled and in heaviness till the next morning.” But, in
the midst of all, he kept waiting upon God continually, read
the New Testament, conquered temptations, and gained increasing
power to trust and to rejoice in God his Saviour. He
had to fight; but he was not, as formerly, subdued.</p>

<p>He went to Oxford; but the whole of his old Methodist
friends were now dispersed. Here he preached his celebrated
sermon in St. Mary’s, before the university, on the text, “By
grace are ye saved, through faith;” a sermon which, in
November following, was published by James Hutton, pp. 25,
price threepence. In this discourse, he showed that the
faith through which we are saved is not barely the faith of a
heathen, who believes that God is, and that He is a rewarder
of them that diligently seek Him; nor, secondly, is it the faith
of a devil, who, in addition to the faith of a heathen, believes
that Jesus is the Son of God, the Christ, the Saviour of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
world; nor, thirdly, is it barely the faith which the apostles
had while Christ was yet upon earth, although they so believed
in Christ as to leave all and follow Him, had power to work
miracles, and were sent to preach; but, fourthly, “it is a full
reliance on the blood of Christ,—a trust in the merits of His
life, death, and resurrection,—a recumbency upon Him as our
atonement and our life, as given for us and living in us; and,
in consequence hereof, a closing with Him and cleaving to
Him, as our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,
or, in one word, our salvation.”</p>

<p>The salvation obtained by such a faith is described as being
a salvation—(1) From the guilt of all past sin; (2) From
servile fear; (3) From the power of sin. The man having
it is pardoned; he has the witness of the Spirit that he is a
child of God; he is born again; and he lives without sin.</p>

<p>Wesley further answers objections to this doctrine, and shows
that to preach salvation by faith only is not to preach against
holiness and good works; neither does it lead men into pride,
nor drive them to despair. He maintains that never was the
preaching of this doctrine more seasonable than now, and that
nothing else can effectually prevent the increase of the popish
delusion. It was this which drove Popery out of the kingdom,
and it is this alone that can keep it out.</p>

<p>This remarkable sermon was preached eighteen days after
Wesley’s conversion—not on June 18, as is stated in Wesley’s
collected works, but on June 11. Well would it be if, at the
present day, the same great doctrine were as plainly preached
as Wesley preached it. For want of it, the church is gliding
into a sort of religious scepticism; and this, above all things
else, would prove a check to the spread of the popish errors
and practices, which are too successfully setting at defiance all
the wisdom and power of man to prevent their triumph.</p>

<p>In the same year Wesley published another sermon, “On
God’s Free Grace,”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> in which he gave equal prominence to
another great Bible truth, namely, that “the grace or love of
God, whence cometh our salvation, is <i>free in all</i>, and <i>free for
all</i>.” And then, in defence of himself as a good Churchman,
he issued a small 12mo pamphlet of sixteen pages, entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
“The Doctrine of Salvation, Faith, and Good Works: extracted
from the Homilies of the Church of England.” Here
he shows that the doctrine of that Church is, that the sinner
is justified by faith only; and yet this faith does not exclude
repentance, hope, love, and fear of God; but shuts them
out from the office of justifying. “So that, although they be
all present together in him that is justified, yet they justify
not altogether.” “Neither does faith shut out good works,
necessary to be done afterwards; but we are not to do them
with the intent of being justified by doing them.” He further
shows that “justification is the office of God only,—a blessing
which we receive of Him by His free mercy, through the only
merits of His beloved Son.” He adds: “the right and true
Christian faith is not only to believe that holy Scripture and
the articles of our faith are true, but also to have a sure trust
and confidence to be saved from everlasting damnation by
Christ; whereof doth follow a loving heart to obey His commandments.”
He maintains further that, without this true
saving faith, the works we do cannot be good and acceptable
in the sight of God. “Faith giveth life to the soul, and they
are as much dead to God who want faith, as they are to the
world whose bodies want souls. Without faith all we do is
but dead before God, be it ever so glorious before man.”</p>

<p>Such then were the great doctrines which Wesley grasped,
and began to preach in 1738. It was the preaching of these
doctrines that gave birth to the greatest revival of religion
chronicled in the history of the church of Christ. From such
doctrines Wesley never wavered; and God forbid that they
should ever be abandoned, or even partially neglected, by any
of Wesley’s successors. They are not Moravian whims, or
the fancies of fanatics. They are a great deal more than even
Bible truths of subordinate importance. They are essentially
and vitally connected with man’s salvation both here and
hereafter, and no church has ever prospered except in proportion
as its ministers have prominently and faithfully taught
and enforced them in their congregations.</p>

<p>It may reasonably be asked how was it that Wesley—the
son of a most able divine of the Church of England, and
himself a man of extensive learning, and a devoted student of
Christian truth—how was it, that he lived so long without a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
knowledge of one of the greatest, and yet most clearly taught
doctrines of the holy Bible, the doctrine of the sinner’s salvation
by faith alone? Wesley himself tells us: from early life
he had been warned against the papistical error of laying too
much stress on outward works. After this, he read certain
Lutheran and Calvinist authors, whose confused and indigested
expositions magnified faith to such an amazing size
that it quite hid all the rest of the commandments. In
this labyrinth he was bewildered. He wished, on the one
hand, to avoid the popish doctrine of salvation by works;
but, in doing this, he was beset, on the other hand, with an
uncouth hypothesis concerning salvation by faith, which he
found it impossible to reconcile either with Scripture or common
sense. From these well meaning but wrong headed
writers, he turned to authors like Beveridge, Nelson, and
Jeremy Taylor, by whom his difficulties were, to some extent,
relieved; but even these he found interpreting Scripture in
different ways, and he was nearly as much confused as ever.
After this, he was taught that he ought to interpret the Bible
by the general teachings of the ancient church. Adopting
this rule, he, for a season, made antiquity a co-ordinate rather
than subordinate rule with Scripture, and, by extending his
antiquity principle too far, his confusion of mind became
greater instead of less. He then became acquainted with
the Mystics, whose “noble descriptions of union with God,
and internal religion, made everything else appear mean
and flat;” yet here again, on reflection, he found that he was
wrong. Mysticism was nothing like the religion which Christ
and His apostles lived and taught.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Thus was this sincere
and earnest inquirer after truth led to and fro in a wilderness
of perplexing entanglements, until Peter Bohler took
him by the hand, and led him as a contrite sinner to the
cross of Christ.</p>

<p>Ten days before his conversion, Wesley wrote a somewhat
petulant letter to William Law, telling him that he did so in
obedience to what he considered the call of God. He informs
him that, for two years, he had been preaching after the model
of his “Serious Call,” and “Christian Perfection,” and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
result had been to convince the people that the law of God
was holy, but that, when they attempted to fulfil it, they found
themselves without power. Wesley declares that he himself
was in this state, and might have groaned in it till he died if
he had not been directed to Peter Bohler. He then proceeds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now, sir, suffer me to ask, how will you answer it to our common
Lord, that you never gave me this advice? Did you never read the Acts
of the Apostles, or the answer of Paul to him who said, ‘What must I do
to be saved?’ Or are you wiser than he? Why did I scarce ever hear you
name the name of Christ? Never so as to ground anything upon faith in
His blood? Who is this who is laying another foundation? If you
say you advised other things as preparatory to this, what is this but
laying a foundation below the foundation? If you say you advised them
because you knew that I had faith already, verily you knew nothing of
me. I know that I had not faith, unless the faith of a devil, the faith of
Judas: that speculative, notional, airy shadow, which lives in the head
not in the heart. But what is this to the living, justifying faith in the
blood of Jesus? the faith that cleanseth from sin, that gives us to have
free access to the Father; to rejoice in hope of the glory of God; to have
the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which
dwelleth in us, and the Spirit itself bearing witness with our spirits that
we are the children of God?</p>

<p>“I beseech you, sir, by the mercies of God, to consider deeply and
impartially whether the true reason of your never pressing this upon me
was not this—that you had it not yourself? Whether that man of God
[Bohler] was not in the right, who gave this account of a late interview
he had with you? ‘I began speaking to him of faith in Christ: he was
silent. Then he began to speak of mystical matters. I spake to him of
faith in Christ again: he was silent. Then he began to speak of mystical
matters again. I saw his state at once.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley then adds that Bohler thought the state of Law to
be a dangerous one; and intimates that Bohler’s opinion was
of great consequence, because he had the Spirit of God; and
finally, he concludes his not too courteous epistle with:
“Once more, sir, let me beg you to consider whether your
extreme roughness, and morose and sour behaviour, at least
on many occasions, can possibly be the fruit of a living faith
in Christ?”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>This was an uncalled for, rough, morose attack upon a man
of the greatest ability, of distinguished though mistaken piety,
whose works Wesley had read with the highest admiration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
whose advice Wesley had sought, and who was nearly old
enough to be Wesley’s father. Law replied to it in a letter
dated May 19, 1738. After some withering sarcasm, in reference
to Wesley having written his letter in obedience to the
call of God, Law proceeds to say:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have had a great many conversations with me, and you never
were with me for half an hour without my being large upon that very doctrine,
which you make me totally silent and ignorant of. The second time
I saw you I put into your hands the little book of the German theology,
and said all that I could in recommendation of the doctrine contained in it.
If that book does not plainly lead you to Jesus Christ, I am content to
know as little of Christianity as you are pleased to believe; or if you are
for stripping yourself naked of your own works, or righteousness, further
than that book directs, I had rather you were taught that doctrine by any one
else than by me. Above a year ago, I published a book against the ‘Plain
Account of the Sacrament,’ etc. You may perhaps be too much prejudiced
against me to read it; but, as you have made yourself a judge of the
state of my heart, and of my knowledge in Christ, you ought to have
seen that book to help you to make a right judgment of my sentiments.
What I have there written I judge to be well timed after my former discourses.
I have been governed through all that I have written and done
by these two common, fundamental, unchangeable maxims of our Lord:
‘<i>Without Me ye can do nothing:</i>’ ‘<i>If any man will come after Me or be
My disciple, let him take up his cross and follow Me.</i>’ If you are for
separating the doctrine of the cross from faith in Christ, or following Him,
you have numbers and names enough on your side, but not me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Law continues: “Let me advise you not to be too hasty in
believing that because you have changed your language you
have changed your faith. The head can as easily amuse itself
with a living and justifying faith in the blood of Jesus as with
any other notion; and the heart which you suppose to be a
place of security, as being the seat of self-love, is more deceitful
than the head.”</p>

<p>A lengthened correspondence followed, which Mr. Law concluded
thus:—“Who made me your teacher? or can make me
answerable for any defects in your knowledge? You sought
my acquaintance; you came to me as you pleased, and on
what occasion you pleased, and to say to me what you
pleased. If it was my business to put this question to you, and
if you have a right to charge me with guilt for the neglect of
it, may you not much more reasonably accuse them who have
authoritatively charge over you? Did the Church in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
you are educated put this question to you? Did the bishop
who ordained you either deacon or priest do this for you?
Did the bishop who sent you a missionary to Georgia require
this of you? Pray, sir, be at peace with me.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>This was a miserable squabble, into which Wesley foolishly
rushed, and out of which he came not victorious, but vanquished.
It was an unfortunate commencement of a new
Christian life, and led to an estrangement between two great
and good men, which ought never to have existed. No doubt,
the theology of William Law was defective; but to charge him
with the guilt of Wesley’s want of faith, and to accuse him of
extremely rough, morose, and sour behaviour, was a deplorable
outrage against good manners.</p>

<p>But this was not the only unpleasantness which now sprang
up. The Moravian movement and the new conversions began
to attract great attention and to create some alarm. As might
naturally be expected, amid so much excitement, there was a
mixture of extravagance. The sister of Mr. Bray dreamed that
at night she heard a knock at her door, and on opening it saw
a person dressed in white. She asked him who he was, and
he answered, “I am Jesus Christ.” She awoke in a fright, but
a day or two after was filled with faith, and was commanded
by an unseen power to go to Charles Wesley, who was ill, and
assure him from Christ of his recovery of soul and body. In a
prayer-meeting a Mr. Verding declared that he had just seen,
as it were, a whole army rushing by him and bearing the
broken body of Christ; a sight which was overpowering, and
cast him into a cold sweat. A young man, as he entered St.
Dunstan’s church to receive the sacrament, was met by Christ
carrying His cross in His hands: and a woman dreamed that
a ball of fire fell upon her, and fired her soul. Samuel
Wesley, of Tiverton, to whom these things were related,
justly deemed them “downright madness;” and, in his anger,
went so far as to wish that those “canting fellows,” as he
called the Moravians, “who talked of <i>indwellings</i>, <i>experiences</i>,
<i>getting into Christ</i>,” etc., had been somewhere else.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>The chief cause of anxiety, however, arose from Mrs.
Hutton’s description of her two lodgers. She relates that,
when the two Wesleys returned from Georgia, she received
and treated them with the utmost love and tenderness; but
John was now “turned a wild enthusiast.” While her husband
was reading to a number of people in his study a
sermon of Bishop Blackall’s, John Wesley stood up and told
the company that, five days ago, he was not a Christian.
Mr. Hutton was thunderstruck, and said, “Have a care, Mr.
Wesley, how you despise the benefits received by the two
sacraments;” but Wesley repeated his declaration, upon
which Mrs. Hutton answered, “If you have not been a
Christian ever since I knew you, you have been a great
hypocrite, for you made us all believe that you were one.”
To this Wesley replied that, “When we renounce everything
but faith and get into Christ, then, and not till then,
have we any reason to believe that we are Christians.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutton, in writing an account of all this to Samuel
Wesley, adds that her two children had so high an opinion of
Wesley’s sanctity and judgment that they were in great
danger of being drawn into his “wild notions;” that Wesley
had “abridged the life of one Halyburton, a Presbyterian
teacher in Scotland,” and that her son had designed to print
it, but she and her husband had forbidden him to promote
such “rank fanaticism;” and that all his converts were
“directed to get an assurance of their sins being pardoned,”
and to expect this in “an instant.” She acknowledges that
the two Wesleys “are men of great parts and learning;” but
they were now under a “strange delusion;” and she entreats
their brother Samuel to stop this “wildfire,” if he can.</p>

<p>Samuel Wesley’s reply is dated, “Tiverton, June 17, 1738.”
He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am sufficiently sensible of yours and Mr. Hutton’s kindness to my
brothers, and shall always acknowledge it. Falling into enthusiasm is
being lost with a witness; and, if you are troubled for two of your children,
you may be sure I am so for two whom I may, in some sense, call <i>mine</i>.
What Jack means by his not being a Christian till last month, I understand
not. Had he never been in covenant with God? Then, as Mr.
Hutton observed, baptism was nothing. Had he totally apostatized from
it? I dare say not; and yet he must either be unbaptized, or an apostate,
to make his words true.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If renouncing everything but faith means rejecting all merit of our own
good works, what Protestant does not do that? Even Bellarmine on his
death-bed is said to have renounced all merits but those of Christ. But if
this renouncing regards good works in any other sense, as being unnecessary,
it is wretchedly wicked.</p>

<p>“I hope your son does not think it as plainly revealed that he shall print
an enthusiastic book, as it is, that he should obey his father and his
mother. God deliver us from visions that shall make the law of God vain!
I pleased myself with the expectation of seeing Jack; but now I am afraid
of it. I know not where to direct to him, or where he is. I will write to
Charles as soon as I can. In the meantime I heartily pray God to stop
the progress of this lunacy.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Samuel asked his brother what he meant by being made a
Christian. John replied:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By a Christian, I mean one who so believes in Christ as that sin hath
no more dominion over him; and, in this obvious sense of the word, I was
not a Christian till the 24th of May last past. Till then sin had dominion
over me, although I fought with it continually; but, from that time to
this, it hath not. Such is the free grace of God in Christ. If you ask me,
by what means I am made free? I answer, by faith in Christ; by such a
sort or degree of faith as I had not till that day. Some measure of this
faith, which bringeth salvation or victory over sin, and which implies
peace and trust in God through Christ, I now enjoy by His free mercy;
though in very deed it is in me but as a grain of mustard seed. For the
‘πληροφορια πιστεως,—the seal of the Spirit, the love of God shed abroad in
my heart, and producing joy in the Holy Ghost, joy which no man taketh
away, joy unspeakable and full of glory,’—this witness of the Spirit I have
not; but I wait patiently for it. I know many who have already received
it; and, having seen and spoken with a cloud of witnesses abroad,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> as well
as in my own country, I cannot doubt but that believers who wait and
pray for it will find these scriptures fulfilled in themselves. My hope is,
that they will be fulfilled in me. I build on Christ, the Rock of Ages.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The reader will observe here a strange confession, which
has seldom, if ever, been noticed. The letter, from which the
above is taken, was written October 23, 1738, five months
after Wesley’s conversion; and yet he here distinctly states
that, as yet, he was not possessed of the witness of the Spirit;
but was waiting for it. This is contrary to the commonly
received notion, and yet it is in perfect accordance with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
remarkable entry in his journal, under the date of October 14.
He there most carefully examines his religious state by
comparing it with the text, “If any man be in Christ, he is a
new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things
are become new.” In many respects, he judged himself a new
creature; but, in others, he feared that he was not. Earthly
desires often arose within him, though he was enabled to put
them under his feet through Christ strengthening him. To
some extent, he possessed longsuffering, gentleness, meekness,
and temperance; but he had to complain of his want of love,
peace, and joy. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot find in myself the love of God, or of Christ. Hence my
deadness and wanderings in public prayer: hence it is that, even in the
holy communion, I have frequently no more than a cold attention. Again,
I have not that joy in the Holy Ghost; no settled, lasting joy. Nor have
I such a peace as excludes the possibility either of fear or doubt. When
holy men have told me I had no faith, I have often doubted whether I had
or no. And these doubts have made me very uneasy, till I was relieved
by prayer and the holy Scriptures. Yet, upon the whole, although I have
not yet that joy in the Holy Ghost, nor the full assurance of faith,—much
less am I, in the full sense of the words, ‘in Christ a new creature,’—I
nevertheless trust that I have a measure of faith, and am ‘accepted in the
Beloved;’ I trust ‘the handwriting that was against me is blotted out,’
and that I am ‘reconciled to God’ through His Son.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is another entry, similar to this, under the date of
December 16; and again, on January 4, 1739, he uses even
stronger language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My friends affirm I am mad, because I said I was not a Christian a
year ago. I affirm, I am not a Christian now. Indeed, what I might have
been I know not, had I been faithful to the grace then given, when, expecting
nothing less, I received such a sense of the forgiveness of my sins
as till then I never knew. But that I am not a Christian at this day, I as
assuredly know, as that Jesus is the Christ. For a Christian is one who
has the fruits of the Spirit of Christ, which (to mention no more) are love,
peace, joy. But these I have not. I have not any love of God. I do not
love either the Father or the Son. Do you ask, how do I know whether
I love God, I answer by another question, ‘How do you know whether you
love me?’ Why, as you know whether you are hot or cold. You feel
this moment that you do or do not love me. And I feel this moment I
do not love God; which therefore I know, because I feel it. And I know
it also by St. John’s plain rule, ‘If any man love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him.’ For I love the world. I desire the things of the
world, some or other of them; and have done all my life. I have always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
placed some part of my happiness in some or other of the things that are
seen, particularly in meat and drink, and in the company of those I
loved. For many years, I have been, yea, and still am, hankering after a
happiness, in loving and being loved by one or another. And in these I
have, from time to time, taken more pleasure than in God.</p>

<p>“Again, joy in the Holy Ghost I have not. I have now and then some
starts of joy in God; but it is not that joy. For it is not abiding.
Neither is it greater than I have had on some worldly occasions. So that
I can in nowise be said to ‘rejoice evermore;’ much less to ‘rejoice with
joy unspeakable and full of glory.’</p>

<p>“Yet again: I have not ‘the peace of God;’ that peace, peculiarly so
called. The peace I have may be accounted for on natural principles. I
have health, strength, friends, a competent fortune, and a composed,
cheerful temper. Who would not have a sort of peace in such circumstances?
But I have none which can, with any propriety, be called ‘a
peace which passeth all understanding.’</p>

<p>“From hence I conclude, though I have given, and do give, all my
goods to feed the poor, I am not a Christian. Though I have endured
hardship, though I have in all things denied myself and taken up my cross,
I am not a Christian. My works are nothing; my sufferings are nothing;
I have not the fruits of the Spirit of Christ. Though I have constantly
used all the means of grace for twenty years, I am not a Christian.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is extremely puzzling; but we are bound to give it as
we find it. It may be said that Wesley merely says, that
“one who had had the form of godliness many years wrote
these reflections;” but, comparing them with the two entries
under the dates of October 14 and December 16, 1738, and
with his letter to his brother Samuel, dated October 30, it
would be folly to contend that he was not relating his own
experience. The reader must form his own opinion, and
grapple with the difficulties, thus presented, as he best can.
Wesley acknowledges, in the above extract, that, some months
before, he “received such a sense of the forgiveness of his sins
as till then he never knew;” and yet here we find him full of
doubt, and writing the bitterest things against himself.</p>

<p>Let us pursue his correspondence with his brother Samuel
a little farther. Wesley held the doctrine of the Spirit’s
witness; though he asserts he did not yet experience it.
Samuel, in a letter dated November 15, 1738, asks his brother
“whether he will own or disown, in terms, the necessity of a
sensible information from God of pardon?”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> This was not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
fair putting of the question. Wesley had defined the πληροφορια
πιστεως, or witness of the Spirit, as “the love of God
shed abroad in the heart, producing joy which no man taketh
away; joy unspeakable and full of glory:” but his brother
here changes the term <i>witness</i>, and what it meant, to the term
“<i>sensible information</i>,” that is, information received through
the senses, thus connecting with the witness visions and
voices, and other Moravian follies at that time rampant.</p>

<p>A fortnight later Wesley replied to this:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe every Christian, who has not yet received it, should pray for
the witness of God’s Spirit that he is a child of God. This witness, I
believe, is necessary for my salvation. How far invincible ignorance may
excuse others I know not. But this, you say, is delusive and dangerous,
because it encourages and abets idle visions and dreams. It may do this
accidentally, but not essentially; but this is no objection against it; for,
in the same way, weak minds may pervert to an idle use every truth in the
oracles of God. Such visions, indeed, as you mention are given up; but
does it follow that visions and dreams in general are bad branches of a
bad root? God forbid. This would prove more than you desire.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In answer, Samuel, on December 13, declares that his
brother misinterprets the witness of the Spirit, and refers him
to a sermon of Bishop Bull’s in proof. John replies, that
Bishop Bull’s sermon is full of gross perversions of Scripture;
and adds: “I find more persons, day by day, who experience
a clear evidence of their being in a state of salvation; but I
never said this continues equally clear in all, as long as they
continue in a state of salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Samuel’s answer is dated Tiverton, March 26, 1739, in
which he argues that the witness of the Spirit is not necessary
to salvation; and refers, in proof of this, to the case of baptized
infants, and to persons of a gloomy constitution.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Nine days afterwards, Wesley re-asserted that he had seen
many persons changed in a moment from the spirit of horror,
fear, and despair, to the spirit of hope, joy, and peace; and
from sinful desires, till then reigning over them, to a pure
desire of doing the will of God. He also knew that this great
change, in several persons, had been wrought either in sleep,
or during a strong representation, to the eye of their minds, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Christ, either on the cross, or in glory. He also argues, that
his brother’s reference to infants and persons of a gloomy
constitution fails to sustain his point; because no kind of
assurance is essential to the salvation of infants; and persons
of a gloomy constitution, so far from being doomed to die
without the assurance, have, to his own certain knowledge,
even when almost mad, been brought in a moment into a
state of firm, lasting peace and joy.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Other letters might be quoted; but enough has been said
to show the views which Wesley now held concerning the
witness of the Spirit. He believed the witness was necessary
to his own salvation; and, yet, he declares he has it not. He
asserts that he has known instances in which it has been
granted in dreams; but he does not insist that dreams are
an essential medium. The whole affair is puzzling. On May
24, 1738, he “received such a sense of the forgiveness of
sins as till then he never knew;” and yet, months afterwards,
he declares, in the most explicit terms, that he was now living
without the enjoyment of the Spirit’s witness. How is this
discrepancy to be explained? Had he lost the sense of forgiveness
which he received on May 24? Or was he attaching
to the witness of the Spirit a signification too high? If he
had not the witness at the beginning of 1739, when did he
obtain it afterwards? All these questions will naturally occur
to the thoughtful reader; but they are more easily asked than
answered.</p>

<p>The simple truth seems to be, that while Wesley heard
much among the Moravians that was scriptural, he also heard
much that was otherwise; and paid more attention to their
experiences, both in England and in Germany, than was desirable,
or for his good. His high opinion of the people’s piety
made it easy to believe even many of their foolish statements.
He got into a labyrinth, and could hardly tell where he was.
Months before, he had believed on Christ to the saving of his
soul; and yet now he bitterly exclaims that he is not a
Christian. He was, for a season, bewildered with the brightness
of great truths bursting for the first time on his vision,
and with the distracting glare of religious testimonies—new,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
but yet earnest and sincere—of great importance, and yet
mixed with much that was fanatical and foolish. Out of such
a maze this earnest man had to find his way as he best could.
We know his subsequent career, and we know the doctrines
that he taught. The mists of early education, and the vapours
of Moravian imagination, were soon scattered by the bright
sunshine which was shed upon him; and in the midst of
which, to the end of his career, he was wont to live, and to
testify, “The testimony of the Spirit is an inward impression
on the soul, whereby the Spirit of God directly witnesses to
my spirit that I am a child of God; that Jesus Christ hath
loved me, and given Himself for me; and that all my sins
are blotted out, and I, even I, am reconciled to God.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Wesley had been brought into strange communion with
Moravians in his voyage to Georgia. At Savannah he had
met with Spangenberg. On his return to London he found
Bohler, and was induced to become a member of the first
Moravian society, founded at Fetter Lane. The rules of that
society are before us, entitled, “Orders of a Religious Society
meeting in Fetter Lane; in obedience to the command
of God by St. James, and by the advice of Peter Boehler,
May 1, 1738.” These rules provide for a meeting of the
members once a week, to confess their faults one to another,
and to pray for one another that they may be healed. A
month later, it was agreed that the persons thus meeting in
<i>society</i> should be divided into <i>bands</i>, of not fewer than five or
more than ten; and that some one in each band should be
desired to interrogate the rest, and should be called the leader.
Each band was to meet twice a week; every person was to
come punctually at the hour appointed; every meeting was
to begin and end with singing and prayer; and all the bands
were to have a conference every Wednesday night. Any
person absenting himself from his band-meeting, without some
extraordinary reason, was to be first privately admonished,
and if he were absent a second time, to be reproved before
the whole society. Any member, desiring or designing to
take a journey, was first to have, if possible, the approbation
of the bands; and all who were in clubs were requested to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
withdraw their names from such associations. Any one
desiring to be admitted was to be asked his reasons for this,
and whether he would be entirely open, using no kind of
reserve, least of all in the case of love or courtship. Every
fourth Saturday was to be observed as a day of general
intercession, from twelve to two, from three to five, and from
six to eight o’clock; and, on one Sunday in every month,
a general lovefeast was to be held from seven till ten at
night. In order to a continual intercession, every member was
to choose some hour, either of the day or night, to spend in
prayer, chiefly for his brethren; and, in order to a continual
fast, three of the members were to fast every day, Sundays
and holidays excepted, and spend as much of the day as
possible in retirement from business and in prayer. Each
person was to pay to the leader of his band, at least once a
month, what he could afford towards the general expenses;
and any person not conforming to the rules of the society, after
being thrice admonished, was to be expelled.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, Wesley wished to know something more
of the singular people with whom he had been brought in contact;
and accordingly, three weeks after his conversion, he
started for their chief settlement at Herrnhuth, in Germany.
One of his companions was his friend Ingham, and another
was John Toltschig,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> one of the first fugitives who fled to
Herrnhuth from the fierce persecution in Moravia in 1724.</p>

<p>At Rotterdam, Dr. Koker, a physician, treated them with
kindness; but at Gondart several of the inns refused to entertain
them, and it “was with difficulty they at last found one
which did them the favour to take their money for their meat
and drink, and the use of two or three bad beds.”</p>

<p>On June 16, they arrived at Ysselstein, the home of Baron
Watteville, who had been a fellow student of Count Zinzendorf,
and one of the young gentlemen, at the academy in Halle,
who about the year 1717 had formed an association called
“The Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed,” the object of
which was to promote the conversion of Jews and heathen.</p>

<p>At the time of Wesley’s visit Watteville was at the head of
“a few German brethren and sisters, and about eight” English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Moravians, who were living in three or four small houses, till
one should be built large enough to contain them all. Wesley
and his friends spent a day with them “in hearing the wonderful
work which God was beginning to work over all the earth,”
and in making prayer to Him, “and giving thanks for the
mightiness of His kingdom.”</p>

<p>Proceeding to Amsterdam, Wesley and his companions were
received with great courtesy by Mr. Decknatel, a minister of
the Mennonists, and Dr. Barkhausen, a Muscovite physician.
Here they spent four days, and attended several society meetings,
where “the expounding was in high Dutch.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, June 26, they reached Cologne, “the ugliest,
dirtiest city” Wesley had ever seen. The cathedral he describes
as “mere heaps upon heaps; a huge, misshapen thing,
without either symmetry or neatness belonging to it.” Some
will doubtless differ from Wesley’s judgment concerning this
magnificent though unfinished pile, so venerated for its
sanctity, derived from the monkish stories of the reliques
of the eleven thousand virgins and of the three eastern kings.
Coming out of it, one of Wesley’s companions scrupled to
take off his hat as a popish procession passed, when a papist
cried, “Knock down the Lutheran dog,” a mandate which
would probably have been put into execution if the offender
had not made a timely escape from the zealot’s fury.</p>

<p>Embarking on the majestic Rhine, four days and nights were
spent in reaching Mayence, the boat in which Wesley travelled
being drawn by horses. This, however, gave him ample time
to admire the almost unequalled beauties of one of the finest
rivers in the world. Arriving faint and weary at Frankfort,
they were refused admittance, because they had no passports.
It so happened, however, that Peter Bohler’s father was resident
in the city; and, by his interposition, they procured an
entrance, and were treated in the most friendly manner.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 4, they came to Marienborn, (about
thirty-five miles from Frankfort,) in the neighbourhood of which
Zinzendorf, two years before, had taken up his residence in
an old, ruinous castle called Ronneburg, and where he had
established schools for poor children, whom he fed and clothed
at his own expense. Here also he had formed a missionary
congregation, consisting of forty students from Jena, most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
whom became ministers either in Europe or in missions to the
heathen.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The Moravian family altogether consisted of about
ninety persons, all living in a large house rented by Zinzendorf.
Here Wesley spent a fortnight, conversing with the brethren
in Latin or English, listening to the sermons of the count, and
attending conferences and intercession meetings. Writing to
his brother Samuel, he says: “God has given me at length the
desire of my heart. I am with a church whose conversation is
in heaven; in whom is the mind that was in Christ, and who
so walks as He walked. As they have all one Lord and one
faith, so they are all partakers of one Spirit—the spirit of
meekness and love, which uniformly and continually animates
all their conversation. I believe, in a week, Mr. Ingham and I
shall set out for Herrnhuth, about three hundred and fifty miles
hence. Oh pray for us, that God would sanctify to us all those
precious opportunities.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> It is an odd fact, however, that while
Ingham was allowed to partake of the holy communion,
Wesley was not, because “the congregation saw him to be
<i>homo perturbatus</i>, and that his head had gained an ascendancy
over his heart”; and also because “they were desirous not to
interfere with his plan of effecting good as a clergyman of the
English Church.”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Peculiar reasons—but we give them as
we find them. Hampson, in his life of Wesley, relates that
Zinzendorf, who regarded him as a pupil, ordered him one day
to dig in the garden; and after Wesley had been there
for some time working in his shirt, and when he was in a
high state of perspiration, the lordly count commanded him
to enter a carriage that was waiting, to pay a visit to a
neighbouring noble. Wesley naturally wished to wash his
hands and to put on his coat; but his preceptor forbade him,
saying, “You must be simple, my brother!” This was a full
answer to all remonstrance, and Wesley was simple enough to
obey the mandate of a man who, while professing great
humility, sometimes allowed the pretensions of his feudal
pride to set aside the meekness of his professed piety.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July, Wesley again set out, and on reaching
Weimar was brought before the duke, who asked his object in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
journeying to Herrnhuth. Wesley answered, “To see the
place where the Christians live;” upon which the duke
looked hard, but permitted him to go. On arriving at Halle,
“the King of Prussia’s tall men,” who kept the gates, sent him
and his friends backwards and forwards, from one gate to
another, for nearly two long hours before they were admitted.
Here he inspected, with the greatest interest, the Orphan
House of August Herman Francke, in which six hundred and
fifty children were wholly resident, and three thousand taught.
At Leipsig, the gentlemen of the university treated him with
respect and kindness. At Meissen, two things surprised him—the
extremely beautiful china ware; and the congregation in
the church, where the women wore huge fur caps in the shape
of Turkish turbans; the men sat with their hats on their
heads at the prayers as well as at the sermon, and the parson
was decorated with a habit bedecked with gold and scarlet,
and with a vast cross on both his back and breast. At
Dresden, Wesley was carried from one official to another,
with impertinent solemnity, for above two hours, before he
was suffered to settle at his inn; and greatly wondered that
common sense and common humanity allowed such a senseless,
inhuman usage of strangers.</p>

<p>Wesley arrived at the Moravian settlement at Herrnhuth on
August 1, and found it consisting of about a hundred houses
built on a rising ground. The principal erection was the
orphan house, in the lower part of which was the apothecary’s
shop, and in the upper the chapel, capable of containing six
or seven hundred people. Here he spent nearly the next
fortnight.</p>

<p>The day after his arrival, he attended a lovefeast of the
married women; and on every day, at eleven, a Bible conference,
at which was read a portion of Scripture in the original.
He was also present at a conference for strangers, when
several questions concerning justification were resolved. He
embraced all opportunities of conversing with the most experienced
of the brethren, concerning the great work which
God had wrought within them; and with the teachers and
elders concerning their church discipline.</p>

<p>On the Sunday, after the evening service, all the unmarried
women, according to their usual custom, walked round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
town, singing praise, with instruments of music; and then, on
a small hill, at a little distance from it, knelt in a circle and
joined in prayer; after which they joyously repaired to their
respective homes.</p>

<p>Four times Wesley heard Christian David preach, and also
received from his own lips his private history. The boyhood
of this remarkable man was spent in tending sheep, and his
youth and early manhood partly at the carpenter’s bench, and
partly in the soldier’s tent. He was a zealous papist, and
crawled on his knees before images, performed penances,
invoked departed saints, and went the whole round of Romish
vagaries. He was twenty years old before he had even seen
a Bible; after this, it became nearly the only book he read.
The Bible convinced him of the errors of Popery, and he
resolved to join the Lutherans. At the age of twenty-seven,
he began to preach to his countrymen; numbers were converted
by his artless sermons; persecution followed; the
converts fled; and Herrnhuth was founded. Christian David
continued preaching in Moravia, until his preaching became
the topic of conversation in houses, streets, roads, and markets,
and the whole country was thrown into a state of great excitement.
The people assembled at each other’s houses to sing
hymns and to read the Bible. Shepherds chanted the praises
of their Redeemer as they kept their flocks; servants at their
work talked of nothing but His great salvation; and children
on village greens poured out their fervent prayers before Him.
Many were imprisoned; others were thrust into cellars and
made to stand in water till they were well-nigh frozen; not a
few were loaded with irons and obliged to work as convicts;
and a whole host were condemned to pay heavy fines. All this
arose out of the preaching of the unlettered preacher whom
Wesley heard at Herrnhuth,—the <i>Bush Preacher</i>, as he was
called by the persecuting priests and jesuits of Moravia,—the
man who, five years previous to Wesley’s present visit, conducted
the first missionaries to Greenland, and who, though but
a poor mechanic, preached to the court of the king of Denmark
as he went,—an itinerant evangelist of no mean order, having
paid eleven gospel visits to Moravia, three to Greenland, and
many others to Denmark, England, and Holland, besides visiting
all the Moravian congregations throughout the whole of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Germany,—a man who, when he happened to be at home at
Herrnhuth, and not engaged in active services for the church,
always followed his trade as a carpenter, and secured the
respect and love of both young and old,—a man who often
made mistakes, but was always ready to confess his errors
when pointed out to him,—deeply devoted to the work of
Christ, and living in the closest communion with Him,—shunning
no toil, and fearing no danger,—reading the Bible continually,
and never tiring of its precious truths,—his sermons
wanting in polish, but not in power,—for more than thirty
years an itinerant, out-door German preacher,—and who in
1751, at the age of sixty, went triumphantly to heaven.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Such was the preaching mechanic whom Wesley, the
scholar and the priest, embraced every opportunity of hearing
during his Herrnhuth visit,—a fair specimen of scores in
England whom Wesley, during the next half-century, employed
in the same glorious work. The philosopher may
sneer at the sight of one of the most distinguished fellows of
Lincoln College sitting in the Herrnhuth chapel and in the
carpenter’s cottage, to be taught by a man like this; but let it
be remembered that while the Oxford student, in letters, was
immeasurably superior to the German mechanic, the German
mechanic was as much superior to the Oxford student in the
science of saving truth; and besides that, he spoke not only
from clear convictions, but from personal experience. Even
now many a man, profoundly learned in languages and in
philosophy, might receive knowledge more important than any
he already has, if he would condescend to imitate Wesley’s
example, and stoop to be taught by some poor itinerating
preacher, who, though a wayfaring man, and in all other things
a fool, is yet “wise unto salvation through faith which is in
Christ Jesus.”</p>

<p>The four sermons which Wesley heard Christian David
preach were peculiarly appropriate to his present religious
state. It is a notable fact, however, that instead of instructing
Wesley to expect the witness of the Spirit immediately, he
taught him “that many are children of God and heirs of the
promises, long before they are comforted by the abiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
witness of the Spirit, melting their souls into all gentleness
and meekness; and much more before they are pure in heart
from all self-will and sin.” Christian David told Wesley, in
private, that he had “the forgiveness of sins, and a measure
of the peace of God, for many years before he had that witness
of the Spirit which shut out all doubt and fear.” This is not
<i>Wesleyan</i> doctrine; but it was the doctrine which Wesley was
taught in Germany, and which helped to keep him in that
doubting and fearing state in which we have already seen
him.</p>

<p>Wesley elicited the religious experience of Michael Linner,
the oldest member of the church, which was to the effect that
Michael believed to the saving of his soul two years before he
received the full assurance of faith; though he admitted that
the more usual method is for the Holy Spirit “to give, in one
and the same moment, the forgiveness of sins, and a full assurance
of that forgiveness.” David Nitschmann, one of the four
public teachers of the Herrnhuth community, told Wesley that,
for years after he was delivered from the bondage of sin, he
was troubled with doubts and fears. Martin Döber stated:
“It is common for persons to receive justification through faith
in the blood of Christ before they receive the full assurance
of faith, which God many times withholds till He has tried
whether they will work together with Him in the use of the
first gift.” Augustine Neusser said he could not tell the hour
or day when he first received the full assurance that his sins
were pardoned; for it was not given at once, but grew within
him by degrees. David Schneider’s experience was substantially
the same; but it is right to add, that the experience of
others was of a brighter kind, and confirmative of the scriptural
doctrine that, when sins are forgiven, the Spirit, at the
same moment, gives the assurance of it.</p>

<p>Wesley eagerly listened to the recital of these religious
experiences at Herrnhuth, and became bewildered; and hence
those puzzling declarations concerning his own religious state,
even down to the beginning of 1739, which have been already
given. The truth is, both Wesley and the Moravians seemed
to confound the doctrine of the Spirit’s witness with the doctrine
of sanctification. Because they were not, for a season,
wholly sanctified, they declare that they had not the witness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
of the Spirit or the full assurance of faith. The following, for
instance, is Arvid Gradin’s description of that witness or assurance:
“Repose in the blood of Christ; a firm confidence in
God, and persuasion of His favour; serene peace and steadfast
tranquillity of mind, with a deliverance from every fleshly
desire, and from every outward and inward sin.” This is a
beautiful description of what the Methodists mean by entire
sanctification; but Wesley, taught by the Herrnhuth Moravians,
confounded it, for a time, with what he called “the
witness of the Spirit,—full assurance of faith;” the result
being the use of language, in reference to himself, quite sufficient
to perplex the modern Methodist, who, without paying
attention to these Moravian facts, contents himself with merely
comparing the lucid language of Wesley’s sermons with the
confused and confusing language of those parts of Wesley’s
journal to which we are now adverting.</p>

<p>Wesley spent nearly a fortnight among the Herrnhuth
Christians. He writes:—“I would gladly have spent my life
here. Oh when shall this Christianity cover the earth, as
the waters cover the sea?” The population was divided into
about ninety bands, each of which met twice at least, but
most of them three times, a week, to “confess their faults one
to another, and to pray for one another that they might be
healed.” The rulers of the church had a conference every
week, purely concerning the state of souls; and another every
day on the outward matters of the church. Once a week,
there was a conference for strangers; at which any one might
be present, and propose questions or doubts which he desired
to have resolved. The children and young people were taught
reading, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French,
English, history, and geography. Every morning at eight, the
community had singing, Scripture exposition, and commonly
short prayer; and the same at eight in the evening, concluding
each service with the kiss of peace. On Sundays, service
began at six; at nine, they had public worship at Bertholdsdorf;
at one, the members of the church were divided into
fourteen classes, to each of which was addressed a separate
exhortation; at four, there was service again at Bertholdsdorf;
and at eight, the usual nightly service; after which the young
men went round the town singing songs of praise; and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
the day was ended. On the first Saturday of every month,
the Lord’s supper was administered: when, from ten till two,
the eldest spoke with each communicant in private, concerning
his or her spiritual experience; at two, they dined, and then
washed one another’s feet; after which they sung and prayed;
about ten at night, they received the communion in silence
without any ceremony; and continued without speaking, till
midnight, when they parted. The second Saturday was occupied
as the solemn prayer-day for the children. The third was
a day of general intercession and thanksgiving. And the
fourth was the great monthly conference of all the superiors of
the church. For the last eleven years, they had kept up a perpetual
intercession, which had never ceased day or night, by
different companies spending in succession an hour every day
in prayer for themselves and for other churches. Marriage
was highly reverenced, and no young people were allowed to
be affianced without being placed for a time with married
persons, who instructed them how to behave in their contemplated
new relation. Casting lots was used both in public and
private, to decide points of importance, when the reasons on
each side appeared to be of equal weight. The time usually
spent in sleep was from eleven at night till four in the morning;
three hours a day were allowed for meals; leaving sixteen
for work and sacred services.</p>

<p>Such was Herrnhuth in 1738, the cradle of the modern
Moravian church,—the Jerusalem of the United Brethren. At
present it has about a thousand inhabitants, is well built, well
paved, and scrupulously clean; having in its centre a large
square, in which stands the hall for worship, at the original
consecration of which Zinzendorf offered the striking prayer,
“May God prevent this house standing longer than it continues
to be a dwelling place of love and peace to the praise of
the Redeemer!” On one side of the square is what was once
the residence of Zinzendorf, now the depôt of Moravian
archives; on another, the house of the unmarried brethren;
and on a third, the village inn, the property of the community.
Connection with the brotherhood, except in special cases conceded
by their church authorities, is a condition of residence
in the town; and up to 1848, by the laws of Saxony, any
one who forsook the faith could be compelled to sell what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>ever
property he had within its boundaries. This is now
altered, and the only compulsion that can be exercised is of a
moral character. Still, even yet, with the exception of the
government officials, and a few privileged individuals, the
entire community are members of the Moravian church.
Here sprang up that wondrous brotherhood, which, whilst
other churches were surrendering the great doctrines of the
cross, devoted its life and energies to their world-wide propagation,
and, with a faith which to some seemed presumption,
and a love which approached to the character of a reverential
friendship, went among slumbering peoples and savage races,
insisting on the necessity of personal faith in a personal
Redeemer, and declaring that life in Christ is the highest life
of man.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Wesley left Herrnhuth on August 12, and reached London
on Saturday, September 16. He at once resumed his work
by preaching thrice the next day, and afterwards expounding
in the Minories. On Monday, he rejoiced to meet with the
Moravian society at Fetter Lane, which had increased from
ten members to thirty-two; and, on Tuesday, he went to
the condemned felons in Newgate, and preached to them a
free salvation.</p>

<p>A month subsequent to his return, he wrote as follows to
his Herrnhuth friends:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To the church of God which is in Herrnhuth, John Wesley, an unworthy
presbyter of the church of God in England, wisheth all grace and peace
in our Lord Jesus Christ. Glory be to God, even the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ! for giving me to be an eye-witness of your faith and love
and holy conversation in Christ Jesus. We are endeavouring here to be
followers of you, as ye are of Christ. Fourteen have been added to us
since our return, so that we have now eight bands, all of whom seek for
salvation only in the blood of Christ. As yet, we have only two small
bands of women; the one of three, the other of five persons. But here are
many others, who only wait till we have leisure to instruct them how they
may most effectually build up one another in the faith and love of Him
who gave Himself for them.</p>

<p>“Though my brother and I are not permitted to preach in most of the
churches in London, yet there are others left, wherein we have liberty to
speak the truth as it is in Jesus. Likewise, every evening, and on set
evenings in the week, at two several places, we publish the word of recon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>ciliation,
sometimes to twenty or thirty, sometimes to fifty or sixty, sometimes
to three or four hundred persons, met together to hear it. We begin
and end all our meetings with singing and prayer; and we know that our
Lord heareth prayer, having more than once or twice received our petitions
in that very hour.</p>

<p>“Nor hath He left Himself without other witnesses of His grace and truth.
Ten ministers I know now in England, who lay the right foundation, ‘the
blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.’ Over and above whom I have
found one Anabaptist, and one, if not two, of the teachers among the
Presbyterians here, who I hope love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,
and teach the way of God in truth.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There are three facts in the above quotation which deserve
notice:—1. That Wesley was thoroughly identified with
the London Moravians. 2. That there were other clergymen
besides himself who were evangelical. 3. That he still retained
his high church nonsense, and made a difference
between Church of England “<i>ministers</i>,” and Anabaptist and
Presbyterian “<i>teachers</i>.” This last was pitiable folly, perhaps
not to be wondered at, and yet deserving to be despised.</p>

<p>About the same time, Wesley wrote to Zinzendorf at
Marienborn, thanking him and his countess for their kindness,
and then adding:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I did not return hither at all before the time; for though a great door
and effectual had been opened, the adversaries had laid so many stumbling-blocks
before it, that the weak were daily turned out of the way. Numberless
misunderstandings had arisen, by means of which the way of truth
was much blasphemed; and, hence, had sprung anger, clamour, bitterness,
evil speaking, envyings, strifes, railings, evil surmises; whereby the
enemy had gained such an advantage over the little flock, that ‘of the rest
durst no man join himself to them.’ But it has now pleased our blessed
Master to remove, in great measure, these rocks of offence. The word
of the Lord again runs and is glorified; and this work goes on and prospers.
Great multitudes are everywhere awakened, and cry out, ‘What must we
do to be saved?’ The love and zeal of our brethren in Holland and
Germany, particularly at Herrnhuth, have stirred up many among us, who
will not be comforted till they also partake of the great and precious
promises. I hope to see them at least once more, were it only to speak
freely on a few things which I did not approve, perhaps because I did not
understand them.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The last sentence requires explanation. Notwithstanding
his general admiration of the German Moravians, their sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
was not without spots, for there were sundry things with
which Wesley was not satisfied. What were they? Wesley
himself shall answer. The following is an unfinished letter,
written to the Moravians at Marienborn and Herrnhuth, a
few days only after Wesley’s return from Germany, but which
was never sent:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brethren</span>,—I cannot but rejoice in your stedfast faith, in
your love to our blessed Redeemer, your deadness to the world, your
meekness, temperance, chastity, and love of one another. I greatly
approve of your conferences and bands; of your methods of instructing
children; and, in general, of your great care of the souls committed to
your charge.</p>

<p>“But of some other things I stand in doubt, which I will mention in
love and meekness.</p>

<p>“Is not the count all in all among you?</p>

<p>“Do you not magnify your own church too much?</p>

<p>“Do you not use guile and dissimulation in many cases?</p>

<p>“Are you not of a close, dark, reserved temper and behaviour?”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These were weighty accusations, and will claim attention
hereafter.</p>

<p>Within five weeks after Wesley had returned from Germany,
he and his brother Charles waited upon Dr. Edmund Gibson,
Bishop of London, to answer the complaints he had heard
against them, to the effect that they preached an absolute
assurance of salvation. Gibson was a man of great natural
abilities, a laborious student, and also pious; but he was
occasionally betrayed into intolerance, and sometimes evinced
more zeal for the rights of the Church than discretion. So
great was his ecclesiastical power, that Sir Robert Walpole
was accustomed to be reproached with allowing him the
authority of a pope: “And a very good pope he is,” replied
the premier. The two Wesleys being introduced to him, he
said, “If by assurance you mean an inward persuasion,
whereby a man is conscious in himself, after examining his
life by the law of God, and weighing his own sincerity, that he
is in a state of salvation, and acceptable to God, I don’t see
how any good Christian can be without such assurance.” The
Wesleys meant more by “assurance” than this; but the
doctrine, so far as it went, was one which they themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
preached. The next point discussed was the charge that
they were Antinomians, because they preached justification
by faith only. To this they replied, “Can any one preach
otherwise, who agrees to our church and the Scriptures?” A
third charge was that they had administered baptism to
persons dissatisfied with the lay baptism which they had
already received. Wesley answered, with more high church
bigotry than scriptural enlightenment, that “if a person dissatisfied
with lay baptism,” or, in other words, Dissenters’
baptism, “should desire episcopal, he should think it his duty
to administer it.” Wesley next inquired of his lordship if
“his reading in a religious society made it a conventicle;”
and whether “religious societies are conventicles.” To the
latter question the bishop answered, “I think not; but I
determine nothing;” and he recommended them to read the
acts and laws on the subject for themselves. They then
requested that he would not, in future, receive an accusation
against them, but at the mouth of two or three witnesses.
He said, “No, by no means; and you may have free access
to me at all times.” They thanked his lordship, and departed.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>This was the first muttering of the storm soon to burst
upon them. William Warburton was not yet a bishop, but
he was already a vigorous and well known writer, and rector
of Brand Broughton, in Lincolnshire. This hot-headed parson
was one of the first to fall foul upon the poor Methodists.
Writing to Des Maizeaux, in 1738, he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What think you of our new set of fanatics, called the Methodists?
There is one Wesley, who told a friend of mine, that he had lived most
deliciously last summer in Georgia, sleeping under trees, and feeding
on boiled maize, sauced with the ashes of oak leaves; and that he will
return thither, and then will cast off his English dress, and wear a dried
skin, like the savages, the better to ingratiate himself with them. It
would be well for virtue and religion if this humour would lay hold
generally of our overheated bigots, and send them to cool themselves in
the Indian marshes.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another letter, written in the same year to Dr. Birch, he
says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“A couple of these Methodists, of whom Wesley was one, travelling
into this neighbourhood on foot, took up their lodging with a clergyman
of their acquaintance. The master of the house going into their chamber
in the morning to salute them, perceived a certain vessel full of blood, and,
on asking the occasion, was told it was <i>their method</i>, when the blood
grew rebellious, to draw it off by breathing a vein; that they had been
heated with travel, and thought it proper to cool themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such are specimens of the foul falsehoods which malignant
men already circulated concerning Wesley and his companions.
But, besides this, the Methodist movement began to
be noticed by the pulpit. The Rev. Tipping Silvester, M.A.,
Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Lecturer of St.
Bartholomew the Great, London, preached a sermon on
regeneration before the university of Oxford, at St. Mary’s, on
February 26, which, without mentioning the names of the
Methodist leaders, was evidently meant to be an antidote
to one of their distinguished doctrines. The sermon was
published, 8vo, twenty-eight pages, and on the title page was
“recommended to the religious societies.” The chief point
in the sermon is that infants are born again in baptism.</p>

<p>Another sermon, on “The Doctrine of Assurance,” was
delivered on August 13, in the church of St. Lawrence Jewry,
by the Rev. Arthur Bedford, M.A., chaplain to his royal highness
Frederick Prince of Wales. This also, with an appendix,
was published, 8vo, thirty-nine pages, and had an extensive
circulation. It was avowedly intended to refute the doctrine
of “those who had of late asserted that they who are not
assured of their salvation, by a revelation from the Holy
Ghost, are in a state of damnation.” The preacher argues
that this assurance “is given to very few, and perhaps only to
such whom God calls either to extraordinary services, or to
extraordinary sufferings.” He further argues that to profess
to have received such an assurance savours of spiritual pride,
and cannot but produce bad results.</p>

<p>These were the first sermons published against the doctrines
of Methodism, and both of them were extremely temperate
when compared with others following.</p>

<p>At the end of the year 1738, Wesley drew up a set of rules
for the regulation of the Moravian band societies, some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
which were certainly more inquisitive than wise. Eleven
questions, to be proposed to candidates for admission, were,
upon the whole, unexceptionable; but five others, to be asked of
every member at every weekly meeting, savour far too much
of the popish confessional to be admired. We give them as
an indication of the still unhealthy tone of Wesley’s piety:—</p>

<p>“1. What known sins have you committed since our last
meeting?</p>

<p>“2. What temptations have you met with?</p>

<p>“3. How were you delivered?</p>

<p>“4. What have you thought, said, or done, of which you
doubt whether it be sin or not?</p>

<p>“5. Have you nothing you desire to keep secret?”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>No doubt, such questions were put with the best intentions;
but the thing looked like a prurient prying into secrets which
properly belong alone to a man and his Maker.</p>

<p>The whole of Wesley’s publications, during 1738, have been
already noticed, except “A Collection of Psalms and Hymns,”
eighty-four pages, 12mo. This small volume was published
without the name of either printer or author; but it contains
ample internal evidence of its origin. Its publication was contemplated
immediately after Wesley’s return from Georgia;
and hence the following extract from a letter written by Dr.
Byrom to Charles Wesley, on the 3rd of March, 1738.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As your brother has brought so many hymns translated from the
French, you will have a sufficient number, and no occasion to increase
them by the small addition of Mademoiselle Bourignon’s two little pieces.
I desire you to favour my present weakness, if I judge wrong, and not to
publish them.</p>

<p>“I do not at all desire to discourage your publication. But when you
tell me you write, not for the critic, but for the Christian, it occurs to my
mind that you might as well write for <i>both</i>; or in such a manner that the
critic may, by your writing, be moved to turn Christian, rather than the
Christian turn critic. I should be wanting, I fear, in speaking freely and
friendly upon this matter, if I did not give it as my humble opinion that,
before you publish, you might lay before some experienced Christian
critics the design which you are upon. But I speak this with all submission.
It is very likely that, in these matters, I may want a spur more than
you want a bridle.”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>The book was probably intended for the use of the
Moravian bands and other religious societies’ meetings in
London, with which Wesley was more or less connected. It
contains seventy psalms and hymns; but it is a remarkable
fact that not one of them seems to have been written by
Wesley’s brother Charles. One each is contributed by
Addison, Dryden, and Lord Roscommon. One is from the
Church liturgy, and one anonymous. Three are by Bishop
Ken; four by Norris; six by Herbert; thirteen by Tate and
Brady; thirty-three by Watts; and six are translations by
Wesley himself. The book was never reprinted; but it
formed the basis of another hymn-book, published three years
after, in which exactly one-half of its psalms and hymns
were embodied.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> It was the first<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> of about forty hymnologies
published by the two brothers during the next half-century,
and which, as priceless gems, were scattered broadcast among
the first Methodists.</p>

<p>With Wesley’s first hymn-book we close the first section of
his history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739<br />

Age 36</div>

<p class="drop-cap">LONDON in 1739 was widely different from what it is at
present. The population, including Westminster and all
the parishes within the Bills of Mortality, was about 600,000, or
a fifth of the population now. London Bridge was the only
highway across the majestic Thames that the Londoners
possessed; and that was covered with antique houses, from
end to end, forming a sort of picturesque extension of Gracechurch
Street, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore,—a
narrow, darksome, and dangerous thoroughfare with an arched
gateway at each end of it, generally bristling with spikes, and
often adorned with the heads of traitors. The site of the
present Mansion House was a fruit market, having on one
side of it a row of shady trees and on the other a conduit,
surmounted by an equestrian statue of King Charles II.
Islington, Hoxton, Hackney, and Bethnal Green were country
villages. On the Surrey side, all beyond the King’s Bench
prison was fields and open country. The Elephant and
Castle stands where the small hamlet of Newington then
stood. Walworth, Camberwell, Brixton, Peckham, and Clapham
were rural haunts, far from the hum and noise of the
great city. Even Lambeth was a vast conglomerated
garden, extending from Kennington Common to what is now
Westminster Bridge. Eastward—Blackwall, Poplar, Bow,
and Stepney were somewhat distant collections of scattered
houses, surrounded respectively by fields and gardens. Westward—Chelsea,
Knightsbridge, Marylebone, and Tottenham
Court were all in open country. Even Belgravia was a farm
of arable and pasture land; while all the space, between
Westminster and what is now Vauxhall Bridge, was a dreary
tract of stunted, dusty, trodden grass, the resort of badger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>baiters
and other rampant blackguards, and known by the
name of Tothill Fields.</p>

<p>Moorfields, the scene of Wesley’s earliest evangelistic
labours, and where he opened his Foundery meeting-house,
was what would now-a-days be called a park, laid out in
grass plots, intersected by broad gravel walks, and the
favourite resort of citizens seeking exercise and recreation.
Beneath a row of well grown elms was what the promenaders
designated “the city mall,” and which in the smartness of
its company often rivalled the mall of St. James’s Park. Here
might be seen wives and daughters flaunting in all their
finery and displaying their charms to city maccaronis, whose
hats were cocked diagonally, and who gave themselves quite
as many airs as the aristocratic coxcombs in the royal
grounds. Under the trees were booths, whose fans, toys,
trinkets, and confectionery found ready purchasers; while
on the grass plots were erected mountebank diversions for
the amusement of the people.</p>

<p>What a contrast between London then and London now!
And yet, even then, London was thought to be dangerously
too large. An able writer, in one of the magazines for 1762,
argued that great cities are perilous to a nation’s welfare;
and in proof quoted Nineveh, Babylon, Persepolis, Tyre,
Carthage, Rome, Athens, Memphis, Baalbec, Palmyra, Thebes,
Jerusalem, etc. He contended that it was pernicious policy to
suffer the eighth part of an entire nation to live in one
crowded town; for when so many myriads lived on ground
which produced nothing they were under the necessity of
living by their wits—that is, by sharping and over-reaching,
and by inventing idle and vicious amusements. Hence it was
that in London there was such a multiplication of playhouses,
operas, ridottos, and masquerades; and that almost
one-half of some of the London parishes was converted into
brothels by bawds and pimps. The anonymous alarmist was
doubtless treated with contempt, but his theory deserves
attention.</p>

<p>London was great, but it was wicked. And no wonder.
Riches in the case of nations, as in the case of individuals,
often lead to extravagance and luxury. Thus it was in
England, in the reign of the second George. Superb edifices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
rose up on every hand, almost vieing with the palaces of
princes. Carriages, glittering with gold and crystal, rattled
over city pavements with the utmost ostentation. Ridottos,
balls, masquerades, and midnight banquets, were of constant
occurrence. Every night innumerable lamps illuminated
public gardens, where hosts of fashionable and licentious
fops might be seen lolling in gilded alcoves, killing time, and
lulling their senses into an indolent oblivion. Arrayed in
masks and the strangest dresses, gamblers, actors, and prostitutes
mingled with persons of riches and of rank, and, amid
the din of music and of dancing, conversed obscene discourse,
and whispered indecent slanders. All classes caught the
contagion, and even the tables of shopkeepers and mechanics
were covered with costly dainties. Clerks and apprentices,
servant-maids and cooks, decked themselves in apparel equal
to that of their masters and mistresses; and finical sparks
deemed it their privilege and right to frequent taverns, clubs,
and theatres, adorned with the finest clothes, perukes, and
jewellery.</p>

<p>What resulted from all this? Extravagance created
greater wants than the people had means to meet. Patrimonial
estates, and the gains of honest business were not
enough to satisfy newly engendered appetites; and hence men
appealed to an infernal sorceress, to correct, forsooth, the
errors made in distributing the gifts of Providence. To eke
out means which were found too scanty to gratify licentious
and luxurious passions, robbery was made polite, and gambling
an every day duty. Idleness threw the dice, and Folly
built them into castles; Avarice clutched at gold, but Fraud,
with a sly and quick conveyance, snatched it from his hand.
Even ladies laid wagers at home, while their lords gambled
abroad; and dice began to rattle on the costermonger’s
barrow as well as upon the hazard tables of the noble and the
rich. Money was looked upon as omnipotent; and the more
men got the more they wanted, and especially when it was
spent upon their own indulgences. An avaricious, mercenary
spirit became general, and chiefly for the sake of vain display
and sensual pleasures.</p>

<p>Poverty treads in the footsteps of extravagance. There
were more equipages kept, and yet more taxes for the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
imposed; more diversions, and yet more want; more ladies
of taste, and yet fewer housewives; more pomp, and yet less
hospitality; more expense, and yet less frugality. In 1744,
the grand jury of the county of Middlesex made a presentment
to the effect, that “the advertisements in the newspapers
were seducing the people to places for the encouragement
of luxury, extravagance, and idleness; and that, by this
means, families were ruined, and the kingdom dishonoured;
and that, unless some superior authority put a stop to such
riotous living, they feared it would lead to the destruction
of the nation.”</p>

<p>The town abounded with men who regarded honour, honesty,
and virtue as the merest phantoms;—men with whom promises
were not binding, obligations were nullities, and impudence
a duty;—dastards who might slander their neighbours,
ridicule their superiors, be saucy to their equals, insolent to
their inferiors, and abusive to all; to-day spaniels, to-morrow
bullies, and at all times cowards; to whom learning was a
burden, and books were baubles; vice being their delight,
and virtue their aversion; demons in disguise, all order and
symmetry without, and yet all rancour and rottenness within.</p>

<p>The country was an apt imitator of the vices of the town.
There the squire, having, by idleness and bad company, forgotten
the little learning he acquired at college, too often
devoted himself to drinking and debauchery; while the common
people were ignorant, superstitious, brutal, and bad
behaved. Workmen entered into combinations to extort
higher wages than their labour merited, or than their masters
could afford; and even parliament had to pass enactments
limiting the salaries of tailors. Smuggling was enormous;
and, in 1744, it was calculated that, in the county of Suffolk
only, not fewer than 4,500 horses were employed in carrying
merchandise of a contraband character.</p>

<p>This dark picture might easily be enlarged, not from posterior
writings, or even from the religious publications of the
period, but from periodicals, magazines, and newspapers,
which had no temptation to represent the customs, manners,
usages, and vices of the age in a worse aspect than was
warranted by facts. Wesley, as will be seen hereafter, used
strong and startling language; but there is nothing in Wesley’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
writings which exceeds the hideous delineations found in
the popular literature published contemporaneously by other
impartial and mere worldly writers, who are above suspicion.
The <i>Weekly Miscellany</i> for 1732 broadly asserts that the
people were engulfed in voluptuousness and business; and
that a zeal for godliness looked as odd upon a man as would
the antiquated dress of his great grandfather. It states that
freethinkers were formed into clubs, to propagate their
tenets, and to make the nation a race of profligates; and that
atheism was scattered broadcast throughout the kingdom.
It affirms that it was publicly avowed that vice was profitable
to the state; that the country would be benefited by the
establishment of public stews; and that polygamy, concubinage,
and even sodomy were not sinful.</p>

<p>In many respects the reign of the second George bore a
striking resemblance to the present day. There was unexampled
wealth, followed by luxury, display, dissipation,
gambling, irreligion, and wickedness. The pastoral letters
of Bishop Gibson, published at this period, show that most
pernicious efforts were put forth to undermine religion, and to
make men infidels. One class of writers laboured to set aside
all Christian ordinances, the Christian ministry, and a Christian
church. Another so allegorized the meaning of the
miracles of Christ, as to take away their reality. Others
displayed the utmost zeal for natural religion in opposition to
revealed; and all, or most, under the pretence of pleading for
the liberties of men, ran into the wildest licentiousness. Reason
was recommended as a full and sufficient guide in matters
of religion, and the Scriptures were to be believed only as they
agreed or disagreed with the light of nature.</p>

<p>The same causes give birth to the same effects. Things
reproduce themselves. The words of Solomon are as truthful
now as when he wrote them,—“The thing that hath been, it
is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which
shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.”</p>

<p>By reviving religion, Methodism saved the nation more than
a hundred years ago; and now that the nation presents the
same aspect, to a great extent, as it presented then, and is
threatened with the same disasters, is it not certain that
nothing but an agency analogous to the Methodism then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
raised up will be found sufficient to check the progress of
antiquated errors now revived; to stem the aboundings of
licentiousness; and to make men feel that wealth is given,
not to be spent in display and luxury, but in honouring God,
and in promoting the happiness of the human race?</p>

<p>The revival of religion, which occurred about the time when
Methodism commenced its marvellous career, was a world-wide
one.</p>

<p>The Moravian movement in Germany has been already
noticed.</p>

<p>In America, the work began in 1729, the very year in which
the Oxford Methodists formed their first society. The Rev.
Jonathan Edwards fanned the fire into a holy flame by
preaching the grand old doctrine of “justification by faith
alone.” In the town of Northampton, New England, containing
two hundred families, there was scarcely a single person
at the beginning of the year 1735 who was not deeply convinced
of sin, and earnestly seeking salvation; and from day to
day, for months, there were undeniable instances of genuine
conversion. Almost every house was a house of prayer, and,
in all companies, Christ was the theme of public conversation.
The revival which commenced at Northampton spread
throughout the greater part of the colony. All sorts of
people,—high and low, rich and poor, wise and unwise, moral
and immoral,—simultaneously became the subjects of the
Spirit’s strivings, and were converted. This remarkable movement
took place only a few months before Wesley set sail for
Georgia, and continued for several years afterwards. Mr.
Edwards published a narrative of its most striking incidents;
and also his “Thoughts” as to “the way in which it ought
to be acknowledged and promoted;” and from these two
invaluable treatises we collect the following facts.</p>

<p>In many instances, conviction of sin and conversion were
attended with intense physical excitement. Numbers fell
prostrate on the ground, and cried aloud for mercy. The
bodies of others were convulsed and benumbed. As chaos
preceded creation, so in New England confusion went before
conversion. The work was great and glorious, but was accompanied
with noise and tumult. Men literally <i>cried</i> for mercy;
but the loudest outcries were not so loud as the shrieks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
Voltaire or Volney, when the prospect of eternity unmanned
them. Stout-hearted sinners trembled; but not more than
philosophers at the present day would do, if they had equally
vivid views of the torments of the damned to which sin
exposes them. There were groanings and faintings; transports
and ecstasies; zeal sometimes more fervid than discreet;
and passion not unfrequently more powerful than pious; but,
from one end of the land to the other, multitudes of vain
thoughtless sinners were unmistakably converted, and were
made new creatures in Christ Jesus. Frolicking, night walking,
singing lewd songs, tavern haunting, profane speaking,
and extravagance in dress, were generally abandoned. The
talk of the people was about the favour of God, an interest in
Christ, a sanctified heart, and spiritual blessedness here and
hereafter. The country was full of meetings of persons of all
sorts and ages to read, pray, and sing praises. Oftentimes the
people were wrought up into the highest transports of love,
joy, and admiration, and had such views of the Divine perfections,
and the excellencies of Christ, that, for five or six
hours together, their souls reposed in a kind of sacred elysium,
until the body seemed to sink beneath the weight of Divine
discoveries, and nature was deprived of all ability to stand or
speak. Connected with all this, there were no enthusiastic
impulses, or supposed revelations, but trembling reverence,
the mildest meekness, and warmest charity. To use Edwards’
own language, “The New Jerusalem, in this respect, had
begun to come down from heaven, and perhaps never were
more of the prelibations of heaven’s glory given upon earth.”</p>

<p>Of course there were men who opposed and maligned this
blessed work of God’s Holy Spirit; or, at all events, did their
utmost to discredit it by exposing, as they thought, the
infirmities of those who were the chief agents used in promoting
it. Ministers were blamed for their earnestness in
voice and gesture, and for addressing themselves rather to
the passions of their hearers than their reason. Others were
censured for preaching the terrors of the law too frequently,
and for frightening the people with hell-fire discourses. Objections
were raised against so much time being spent in
religious meetings; though the objectors had been significantly
silent when the selfsame persons had formerly spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
quite as much time, and even more, in taverns, and in sinful
pleasures. Some were disgusted at the new converts so
passionately warning, inviting, and entreating others to be
saved. Some found fault with so much singing, forgetting
that singing is one of the great employments of the beatified
in heaven; and others found equal fault with children being
allowed to meet together to read and pray, thus, unintentionally
perhaps, resembling the priests and scribes, who were
sore displeased when the children saluted Christ by shouting
“Hosannah in the highest!” Thus did men mutter discontent
when they ought to have sung praises; and not a few fell
into the sin of those in olden times, who said concerning
Christ, “He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of
devils.”</p>

<p>At the very time that this marvellous religious revival
broke out in America, a similar work was begun in Wales.
Howel Harris was born at Trevecca in 1714, and, a few
months before the Wesleys went to Georgia, found the forgiveness
of sins, and was made unutterably happy by a
Divine assurance of his adoption into the family of God.
The Wesleys, however, had no acquaintance with him, nor
he with them. While they were on the ocean he left his
home in Wales, and entered the university from which they
had so recently departed; but here he was so distressed
with collegiate immoralities, that, after keeping but a single
term, he returned to his native hills, and, without orders,
began at once to preach the salvation which he himself experienced.
It is a curious fact, not generally noticed, that
the first lay preacher, in the great Methodist movement,
was Howel Harris. He commenced preaching in Wales
just when the Wesleys and Ingham commenced in Georgia;
and, before Wesley reached Bristol in 1739, had been
the means of a most glorious work being wrought in the
neighbouring principality. Up to this period the morals of
the Welsh were deplorably corrupt; and in this respect there
was no difference between rich and poor, ministers and people;
gluttony, drunkenness, and licentiousness were general. In
the pulpits of parish churches the name of Christ was hardly
ever uttered; and, in 1736, there were only six Dissenting
chapels throughout the whole of northern Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>Harris first commenced visiting from house to house in his
own native parish, and in neighbouring ones. Then the
people flocked together, and, almost without knowing it, he
began to preach. The magistrates and clergy threatened
him; but their threats failed to silence him. For a maintenance,
he set up a school, and meantime continued preaching.
Numbers were convinced of sin, and these the young
preacher, only twenty-two years of age, formed into small
societies analogous to those of which he had read in Dr.
Woodward’s History. At the end of 1737, persecuting malice
ejected him from his school; but, as in other instances so
in this, it overshot its mark; for this, instead of silencing the
preacher, made him preach more than ever. He now gave
himself entirely to the work of an evangelist, and henceforth
generally delivered three or four, and sometimes five or
six, sermons every day to crowded congregations. A wide-spread
reformation followed. Public diversions became unfashionable,
and religion became the theme of common conversation.
A few began to help him, of whom the venerable
Rev. Griffith Jones was the most prominent. In 1737, this
devoted clergyman instituted his movable free schools; and
a letter published in the <i>Glasgow Weekly History</i>, of 1742,
describes him as “one of the most excellent preachers in
Great Britain.” Not a few of the teachers in his peripatetic
schools became Methodist preachers; and certainly their
travels as instructors, as well as his own preaching tours,
prepared the way for the Methodist itinerant ministry.</p>

<p>Thus was Howel Harris an itinerant preacher at least a
year and a half before Whitefield and Wesley were; and,
as the brave-hearted herald of hundreds more who were to
follow after him, he met the fiercest persecutions with an
undaunted soul and an unflinching face. Parsons and country
squires menaced him, and mobs swore and flung stones and
sticks at him; but he calmly pursued his way, labouring
almost alone in his own isolated sphere until he met with
Whitefield in the town of Cardiff, in 1739. Whitefield says
he found him “a burning and shining light; a barrier against
profanity and immorality; and an indefatigable promoter of
the gospel of Christ. During the last three years, he had
preached almost twice every day, for three or four hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
together; and, in his evangelistic tours, had visited seven
counties, and had established nearly thirty societies; and
still his sphere of action was enlarging daily.”</p>

<p>Almost contemporaneous with this marvellous work across
the Atlantic and in Wales, was another across the Tweed, in
Scotland. The facts following are taken from “A Faithful
Narrative, written by James Robe, A.M., Minister of the
Gospel at Kilsyth,” and printed in 1742.</p>

<p>For years past, there had been a sensible decay in the
life and power of godliness in Scotland; but, in 1740, Mr.
Robe began to preach upon the doctrine of regeneration.
Meanwhile, a glorious revival of the work of God occurred
at Cambuslang; and, on April 25, 1741, at Kilsyth. Sixteen
children began to hold prayer-meetings in the town of Kirkintilloch,
and the godly excitement became general. On
every hand were heard cries, groans, and the voice of weeping.
On the 16th of May, above thirty persons were awakened
under the ministry of Mr. Robe, and, in a short time after,
hundreds were converted in the country round about. Drunkenness,
and swearing, and other flagrant sins were instantly
abandoned; family worship was set up; meetings for prayer
were established; and the people generally flocked to the
house of God. Young converts held prayer-meetings in
fields, barns, schoolhouses, and the manses of their ministers.
Cambuslang, Kilsyth, Campsie, Kirkintilloch, Auchinloch,
St. Ninians, Gargunnock, Calder, Badernock, Irvine, Long
Dreghorn, Kilmarnock, Larbert, Dundee, Bothwell, Muthill,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other towns, villages, and parishes
were visited with a most gracious outpouring of God’s Holy
Spirit; and scenes of mercy were witnessed quite as striking as
those which were occurring simultaneously both in England
and America. Not a few of the converts, about one sixth
of the whole, suffered such distress of mind, and were under
such powerful religious influence, that they not only cried
and shrieked aloud, but trembled, fainted, and were convulsed
in their bodies most mysteriously—exhibiting the same
physical affections as the converts in New England; and
this evoked considerable opposition, and led the Associate
Presbytery at Dunfermline, to pronounce the movement a
“delusion, and the work of the grand deceiver.” Some were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
seized with such trembling that their friends had to render
them support. Many of the females went into hysterics.
Numbers, on finding peace, broke forth into rapturous weeping,
and had their countenances so lit up with serenity and
brightness, that their neighbours declared they had obtained
not only new hearts, but new faces. A few, but not many,
professed to have visions of hell, of heaven, of the devil, and
of Jesus.</p>

<p>The writer gives these facts as he finds them. Mr. Robe,
in his narrative, extending over hundreds of pages, endeavours
to show that such effects were not without precedents,
and quotes a great number of similar instances which had
occurred, in different places, from the time of the Reformation
downwards. It is no part of our purpose either to explain,
justify, or condemn them. We shall shortly find the same
kind of effects following the preaching of Wesley in England.
At present, the reader is merely reminded of the wondrous
and glorious fact, that the great Methodist revival of religion,
begun in 1739, stood not alone; for God, in His sovereign
mercy, was working works quite as great in Germany,
America, and Scotland. The revival in Germany gave birth
to the heroic, martyr-like Moravian church. That in America
greatly prepared the way for Whitefield, and for the first
Methodist missionaries to that huge continent. That in Scotland
revived the almost expiring piety of the kirk across the
border; and, doubtless, greatly contributed to the devout and
increasing energy and zeal evinced by the different churches
there from that day to this. And that in Wales has issued
in results equally remarkable. God the Spirit is omnipresent,
and can give a universal revival of truth and godliness as
easily as a local one. It is, also, a significant fact, of vast importance,
that the whole of these great revivals were begun by
preaching the same kind of truth. Christian David, the
carpenter, begun the work in Moravia by preaching the
doctrine of salvation by simple faith in Christ; and so did
Jonathan Edwards in America. The revival at Kilsyth
sprang out of Mr. Robe’s sermons on regeneration; and
no one need be told that these were the doctrines which
formed the staple of Wesley’s and Whitefield’s sermons in
Great Britain. This is the truth pre-eminently needed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
man, in all ages, and in all lands; and this is the truth which,
wherever preached, is always honoured, by being made the
means of man’s salvation.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1738, Wesley was almost uniformly
excluded from the pulpits of the Established Church. During
the whole of 1739, the only churches in which he was allowed
to preach, were Basingshaw, Islington, St. Giles’, and St.
Katherine’s churches, London; and the churches at Dummer,
Clifton, Runwick, and St. Mary’s in Exeter. The first two
months of the year were spent in the metropolis; but, with
the exception of expounding in a few private houses, Wesley
had to content himself with preaching not more than half-a-dozen
sermons. In the month of March, he set out for
Oxford, and wrote the following hitherto unpublished
letter to his friend Whitefield. The letter is long, but full
of interest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>March 16, 1739.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—On Thursday, the 8th instant, we breakfasted
at Mr. Score’s, Oxford, who is patiently waiting for the salvation of God.
Thence we went to Mrs. Campton’s, who has set her face as a flint. After
we had spent some time in prayer, Mr. Washington came with Mr. Gibbs,
and read several passages out of Bishop Patrick’s Parable of the Pilgrim,
to prove that we were all under a delusion, and that we were to be justified
by faith and works. Charles Metcalfe withstood him to the face. After
they were gone, we again besought our Lord, that He would maintain
His own cause. Meanwhile, Mr. Washington and Mr. Watson were
going about to all parts, and confirming the unfaithful; and at seven,
when I designed to expound at Mrs. Campton’s, Mr. Washington was got
there before me, and was beginning to read Bishop Bull against the witness
of the Spirit. He told me he was authorized by the minister of the
parish to do this. I advised all who valued their souls to depart; and,
perceiving it to be the less evil of the two, that they who remained might
not be perverted, I entered directly into the controversy, touching both
the cause and fruits of justification. In the midst of the dispute, James
Mears’s wife began to be in pain. I prayed with her when Mr. Washington
was gone; and then we went down to sister Thomas’s. In the way,
Mrs. Mears’s agony so increased, that she could not avoid crying out
aloud in the street. With much difficulty, we got her to Mrs. Shrieve’s,
where God heard us, and sent her deliverance, and where her husband
also was set at liberty soon after. Presently Mrs. Shrieve fell into a
strange agony both of body and mind; her teeth gnashed together; her
knees smote each other; and her whole body trembled exceedingly. We
prayed on; and, within an hour, the storm ceased; and she now enjoys a
sweet calm, having remission of sins, and knowing that her Redeemer
liveth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At my return to Mrs. Fox’s, I found our dear brother Kinchin just
come from Dummer. We rejoiced, and gave thanks, and prayed, and
took sweet counsel together; the result of which was, that instead of
setting out for London, as I designed, on Friday morning, I set out for
Dummer, there being no person to supply the church on Sunday. At
Reading I found a young man, Cennick by name, strong in the faith of
our Lord Jesus. He had begun a society there the week before; but the
minister of the parish had now well-nigh overturned it. Several of the
members of it spent the evening with us, and it pleased God to strengthen
and comfort them.</p>

<p>“On Saturday morning, our brother Cennick rode with me, whom I
found willing to suffer, yea, to die for his Lord. We came to Dummer in
the afternoon: Miss Molly was weak in body, but strong in the Lord and
in the power of His might. Surely her light ought not thus to be hid under
a bushel. She has forgiveness, but not the witness of the Spirit; perhaps
because our dear brother Kinchin seems to think them inseparable.</p>

<p>“On Sunday morning we had a large and attentive congregation. In
the evening, the room at Basingstoke was full, and my mouth was opened.
We expected much opposition, but had none at all.</p>

<p>“On Monday, Mrs. Cleminger being in pain and fear, we prayed, and
her Lord gave her peace. About noon we spent an hour or two in conference
and prayer with Miss Molly; and then set out in a glorious storm;
but I had a calm within. We had appointed the little society at Reading
to meet us in the evening; but the enemy was too vigilant. Almost as
soon as we were out of the town, the minister sent, or went, to each of the
members, and began arguing and threatening, and utterly confounded
them, so that they were all scattered abroad. Mr. Cennick’s own sister
did not dare to see us, but was gone out on purpose to avoid it.</p>

<p>“On Tuesday I came to Oxford again, and from Mrs. Fox’s went
to Mrs. Campton’s. I found the minister of the parish had been there
before me, to whom she had plainly declared, that she had never had a
true faith in Christ till a week ago. After some warm and sharp expressions,
he told her he must repel her from the holy communion. Finding
she was not convinced, even by that argument, he left her calmly rejoicing
in God her Saviour.</p>

<p>“At six in the evening, we were at Mrs. Fox’s society; about seven at
Mrs. Campton’s: the power of the Lord was present at both, and all our
hearts were knit together in love.</p>

<p>“The next day we had an opportunity to confirm most, if not all, the
souls which had been shaken. In the afternoon, I preached at the Castle.
We afterwards joined together in prayer, having now Charles Graves
added to us, who is rooted and grounded in the faith. We then went to
Mr. Gibbs’s room, where were Mr. Washington and Mr. Watson. Here
an hour was spent in conference and prayer, but without any disputing.
At four in the morning I left Oxford. God hath indeed planted and
watered: O may He give the increase.</p>

<p class="psig">

“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Thus did the expelled minister employ his time and
energies. The churches were shut against him; but he found
work in cottages. Half-a-dozen sermons in church pulpits in
three months! No wonder that Wesley escaped to Bristol.
Silence to such a man was intolerable. Priests and their
parasites had gagged him in the metropolis, and he now
started for a new sphere of labour.</p>

<p>His friend Whitefield, during the first five weeks of the
year, was more fortunate, and managed to preach about thirty
sermons in consecrated edifices in and about London. How
long this permission might have lasted, it is difficult to determine;
but, at the beginning of February, Whitefield, like a
flaming seraph, set off to Bath and Bristol. Perhaps his
departure thither was hastened by a fracas which occurred
only three days before at St. Margaret’s, Westminster, where
he yielded to the pressure of the crowd, and preached, despite
the opposition of the minister and his church officers.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Be
that as it may, the news of the disturbance, published in the
<i>Weekly Miscellany</i>, got to the west of England before him;
and, on his arrival, all the churches were closed against him.
In a few days, however, Mr. Penrose granted him the pulpit
of St. Werburgh’s; and Mr. Gibbs the pulpit of St. Mary
Redcliff. The chancellor of Bristol interfered, and threatened
that, if he continued to preach or expound in the diocese
without licence, he should first be suspended and then expelled.
This was the turning point. To muzzle Whitefield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
was impossible; and hence, being shut out of the Bristol
churches, away he went, on February 17, and preached,
in the open air, to two hundred colliers at Kingswood.
This was the boldest step that any of the Methodists had
yet taken; and perhaps none of them but the impulsive,
large-hearted Whitefield would have had sufficient courage
to be the first in such a shocking departure from Church
rules and usages. The Rubicon was passed. A clergyman
had dared to be so irregular as to preach in the open air,
and God had sanctioned the irregularity by making it a
blessing. At the second Kingswood service, Whitefield
says he had two thousand people to hear him; and at the
third, four thousand; while, at the fifth service, the four
thousand were increased to ten. These were marvellous
crowds to assemble out of doors in the bleak months of
February and March. No wonder that Whitefield’s soul
took fire. He declares he never preached with greater power
than now. One day, he would take his stand on Hannam
Mount; another, on Rose Green; and another at the
Fishponds. Then he ran off to Cardiff, and preached in the
town hall; and then to Bath, and preached on the town
common. Then we find him preaching to about four thousand
at Baptist Mills; and, on March 18, his congregation at
Rose Green was estimated at not less than twenty thousand,
to whom he preached nearly an hour and a half.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> A gentleman
lent him a large bowling-green in the heart of Bristol,
and here he preached to seven or eight thousand people. In
the village of Publow, several thousands assembled to hear
him; and, at Coal-pit Heath and other places, the crowds were
quite as great. All this transpired within six weeks, and,
at nearly all these strange and enormous gatherings, Whitefield
made a collection for his orphan house in Georgia.
His soul expanded with his marvellous success. He wished
to try the same experiment elsewhere; and hence he sent
for Wesley to act as his Bristol and Kingswood successor.
Wesley arrived at Bristol on Saturday, March 31; and, the
next day, heard Whitefield at the Bowling-green, Rose Green,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
and Hannam Mount, and was thus introduced to the vast
congregations which Whitefield bequeathed to his godly
care. He was once again ungagged, and, during the nine
months from March to December, preached and expounded
almost without ceasing.</p>

<p>Whitefield, on leaving Wesley at Bristol, made his way
to London, preaching to assembled thousands at Gloucester
and other places. The churches in the metropolis were all
closed against him; but Moorfields and Kennington Common
were still open; and here, to congregations consisting of tens
of thousands, he rapturously proclaimed the glad tidings of
salvation. In one instance, he computed his Kennington congregation
at fifty thousand, to whom he preached an hour and
a half. Eighty coaches were present, besides great numbers
of people on horseback. On another occasion, his collection
for the orphan house in Georgia amounted to upwards of
£47, of which £16 were in half-pence. At another time, the
concourse in Moorfields numbered nearly sixty thousand;
and, at every service, he seems to have made collections for
Georgia, himself acting as one of the collectors. He then
made a short preaching excursion to Hertford, Northampton,
and Bedford, where the stairs of a windmill served him for
a pulpit. On returning to town, he received letters from
Scotland, telling him that Ralph Erskine had turned field
preacher, and had had a congregation of fourteen thousand
people. In June, Wesley came to London to see him, and
preached at Blackheath to twelve or fourteen thousand people,
“the Lord giving him,” writes Whitefield, “ten thousand
times more success than He has given me.” An embargo
unexpectedly laid on shipping detained him in England a
few weeks longer, during which he visited Hertfordshire,
Essex, Gloucestershire, and other places. In July, he joined
his friend Wesley in Bristol, and acknowledged that the
congregations were much more serious and affected than
when he had left them three months before. The Kingswood
colliers, instead of cursing and swearing, now made
the woods ring with their hymns of praise. At length, in
the month of August, Whitefield set sail for America, where
we must leave him until his return to England, in March,
1741.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Charles Wesley passed most of the year 1739 in London
and its neighbourhood. His brother and his friends urged
him to settle at Oxford; but he refused, without further
direction from God. He preached in churches as long as he
was permitted; and, when prohibited, followed the example
of Whitefield and his brother.</p>

<p>For a moment, we must retrace our steps. As already
stated, Wesley himself spent the first two months of 1739 in
London. How was he occupied? On New Year’s day, he was
present at a remarkable lovefeast in Fetter Lane, which continued
until three o’clock in the morning, and which consisted
of himself, his brother, his clerical friends Whitefield, Ingham,
Hall, Kinchin, and Hutchings, and about sixty Moravians.
At the hour mentioned, the power of God came upon them so
mightily, that many cried out for exceeding joy, others fell
prostrate on the ground, and all joined in singing, “We praise
Thee, O God; we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord.” But
even this marvellous manifestation of the majesty of God
failed to remove Wesley’s doubts and fears; for, three days
afterwards, we find him writing the bitterest things against
himself, and concluding with the words, “Though I have
constantly used all the means of grace for twenty years,
I am not a Christian.”</p>

<p>The day after, January 5, seven of the despised Methodist
clergymen (probably the seven just mentioned), held a conference
at Islington, on several matters of great importance,
and, after prayer and fasting, determined what they were
in doubt about, by casting lots. “We parted,” says Whitefield,
“with a full conviction that God was going to do
great things among us;”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> a conviction which was soon
verified.</p>

<p>On January 7, they held another lovefeast at Fetter
Lane, and spent the whole night in prayer and thanksgiving.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>January 25, Wesley baptized five adults at Islington, and
makes a strange distinction, which shows that his views of the
scriptural doctrine of salvation were still hazy and confused.
He writes: “Of the adults I have known baptized lately, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
one was at that time born again, in the full sense of the word;
that is, found a thorough inward change by the love of God
filling her heart. Most of them were only born again in a
lower sense; that is, received the remission of their sins.”
Let the reader compare this with a passage in Wesley’s
sermon on “The Great Privilege of those that are Born of
God,” and he will mark the difference.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has been frequently supposed, that the being born of God was all
one with the being justified; that the new birth and justification were
only different expressions, denoting the same thing: it being certain, on
the one hand, that whoever is justified is also born of God; and on the
other, that whoever is born of God is also justified; yea, that both these
gifts of God are given to every believer in one and the same moment. In
one point of time his sins are blotted out, and he is born again of God.
But though it be allowed, that justification and the new birth are, in point
of time, inseparable from each other, yet are they easily distinguished, as
being not the same, but things of a widely different nature. Justification
implies only a relative, the new birth a real, change. God in justifying us
does something <i>for</i> us; in begetting us again, He does the work <i>in</i> us.
The one restores us to the favour, the other to the image, of God. The
one is the taking away the guilt, the other the taking away the power,
of sin; so that, although they are joined together in point of time, yet
they are of wholly distinct natures.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing can be more scriptural, or more clearly expressed
than this; but comparison with the extract from his journal,
above given, shows that, even in 1739, Wesley was far from
being “a scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven.”
He still had much both to learn and to unlearn; but it was
a happy fact, that he was docile and eager to be taught.
Four days after baptizing the adults at Islington, he sat up
till near one in the morning with Whitefield and two other
clergymen, earnestly listening to a midnight discussion concerning
the doctrine of the new birth.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>During the month of February, he had three separate
interviews with bishops of the Established Church. On
the 6th, he went with Whitefield to the Bishop of
Gloucester, to solicit a subscription for Georgia.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> On the
21st, he and his brother Charles waited on Potter, Archbishop
of Canterbury, who showed them great affection;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
spoke mildly of Whitefield; cautioned them to give no
more umbrage than necessary; to forbear exceptionable
phrases; and to keep to the doctrines of the Church.
They told him they expected persecution; but would abide
by the Church till her articles and homilies were repealed.
From Potter, they proceeded direct to Gibson, Bishop
of London, who denied that he had condemned them,
or even heard much about them. Whitefield’s Journal, he
said, was tainted with enthusiasm, though Whitefield himself
was a pious, well meaning youth. He warned them against
Antinomianism, and dismissed them kindly.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>On the day after their interview with the Bishop of
Gloucester, Whitefield, shut out of the London churches,
set off on his tour to Bristol. Three weeks later, Wesley
wrote him an account of his proceedings in London.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>February 26, 1739.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—Our Lord’s hand is not shortened amongst
us. Yesterday I preached at St. Katherine’s, and at Islington, where the
church was almost as hot as some of the society rooms used to be.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
The fields, after service, were white with people praising God. About
three hundred were present at Mr. S——’s; thence I went to Mr. Bray’s;
thence to Fetter Lane; and, at nine, to Mr. B——’s, where also we
wanted room. To-day I expound in the Minories at four; at Mrs.
W——’s at six; and in Gravel Lane, Bishopsgate, at eight. On Wednesday,
at six, we have a noble company of women, not adorned with gold or
costly apparel, but with a meek and quiet spirit. At the Savoy, on
Thursday evening, we have usually two or three hundred, most of them,
at least, thoroughly awakened. On Friday, Mr. A——’s parlour is more
than filled; as is Mr. P——’s room twice over.”<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This extract will give the reader an idea of Wesley’s weekly
labours in London, up to the time that he set out for Bristol.
Every day had its day’s work. It was impossible for such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
man to be idle: work was essential to his happiness, and
almost to his existence.</p>

<p>Already the people began to have faith in the power of his
piety and prayers. The parents of a lunatic besought his
intercessions on behalf of their afflicted son, who, for five years
past, had been in the habit of beating and tearing himself,
putting his hands into the fire, and thrusting pins into his
flesh. Wesley and his friends yielded to the request on
February 17; and, from that time, the poor creature, though
not fully freed from his calamitous affliction, had more rest
than he had had for two years before. On the same day, a
middle aged, well dressed woman, at a society-meeting in
Beech Lane, was seized as with the agonies of death. For
three years, her friends had accounted her mad, and had bled
and blistered her accordingly. Wesley prayed with her, and,
five days after, she was victoriously delivered, and in a
moment was filled with love and joy.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Within a fortnight, a
third instance, somewhat similar, took place at Oxford,
whither Wesley had gone for a brief visit. Hearing of a
woman who was most violently opposed to the Methodist
revival, he went to her and argued with her. This enraged
her more and more. Wesley broke off the dispute, and
began to pray. In a few minutes, the woman fell into
an extreme agony, both of body and soul; and soon after
cried out with the utmost earnestness, “Now I know I
am forgiven for Christ’s sake;” and, from that hour, set
her face as a flint to declare the faith which before she
persecuted.</p>

<p>We have already seen that, at the beginning of the month
of March, Wesley made a tour to Oxford, and while there
wrote to Whitefield the long letter which has been already
given. On his return to London, he received a most urgent
request from Whitefield to proceed to Bristol without delay.
Wesley hesitated; Charles objected; and the society at Fetter
Lane disputed; but, at length, the matter was decided by
casting lots. Wesley reached Bristol on March 31, and on
April 2 Whitefield left, summing up the results of his first
six weeks of out-door preaching thus: “Many sinners have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
been effectually converted, and all the children of God have
been exceedingly comforted. Several thousands of little
books have been dispersed among the people; about £200
collected for the orphan house; and many poor families
relieved by the bounty of my friend Mr. Seward. And what
gives me the greater comfort is the consideration that my
dear and honoured friend Mr. Wesley is left behind to
confirm those that are awakened; so that I hope, when
I return from Georgia, to see many bold soldiers of Jesus
Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>The next day he wrote to Wesley the following, which is
now for the first time given to the public:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
<i>“April 3, 1739.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,—Yesterday I began to play the madman in Gloucestershire,
by preaching on a table in Thornbury Street. To-day I have
exhorted twice; and by-and-by shall begin a third time; nothing like
doing good by the way. Be pleased to go to Kingswood, and forward the
good work as much as possible. I desire you would open any letters that
come directed for me, and send me a line to Gloucester. I wish you all
the success imaginable in your ministry; and I pray God that my Bristol
friends may grow in grace under it. Parting from them has struck a little
damp upon my joy; but God will quickly revisit,</p>

<p class="psig">
“Honoured sir, your unworthy loving servant,<br />
“<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.</p>
<p>
“The Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Mr. Grevil’s,<br />
“Wine Street, Bristol.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the day of Whitefield’s departure, at four in the
afternoon, Wesley ventured to follow his friend’s example,
and for the first time in England dared to preach in the open
air. His text was appropriate and striking, Isaiah lxi. 1, 2.
The place was “a little eminence in a ground adjoining to the
city.” His feeling was deep. He says: “I could scarce
reconcile myself at first to this strange way of preaching in
the fields; having been all my life, till very lately, so
tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, that
I should have thought the saving of souls almost a sin if it
had not been done in a church.”</p>

<p>Such were the prejudices and the feelings of the man who,
for between fifty and sixty years proved himself the greatest
out-door preacher that ever lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>With the exception of a brief visit to London in June, September,
and November, and of a short tour into Wales and
another to Exeter, Wesley spent the whole of his time, from
April to the end of 1739, in Bristol and its immediate neighbourhood.
Though there are considerable gaps in Wesley’s
journal, during which we lose sight of his texts and sermons,
it is not too much to say that he delivered at least five
hundred discourses and expositions in the nine months of
which we speak; and it is a noticeable fact that only eight of
these were delivered in churches,—six in the church at Clifton,
one at Runwick, and one at Exeter. His preaching plan was
as follows:—an exposition to one or other of the Bristol
societies every night, and preaching every Sunday morning,
and every Monday and Saturday afternoon. At Kingswood,
including Hannam Mount, Rose Green, and Two Mile Hill, he
preached twice every sabbath, and also every alternate
Tuesday and Friday. At Baptist Mills, he preached every
Friday; at Bath, once a fortnight, on Tuesday; and at Pensford,
once a fortnight, on Thursday.</p>

<p>Another point is worth noticing. His chief, almost his only
aim, was to explain to the people the plan of scriptural
salvation; for, as may easily be seen, almost all his texts have
an immediate bearing on this the greatest of all pulpit topics.
Saved himself, his whole soul was absorbed in a grand endeavour
to expound the truth which, above all other truths, is
the means of saving sinners. “The points,” he writes, “I
chiefly insisted upon were four: first, that orthodoxy, or
right opinions, is, at best, but a very slender part of religion,
if it can be allowed to be any part at all; that neither does
religion consist in negatives, in bare harmlessness of any kind;
nor merely in externals, in doing good, or using the means of
grace, in works of piety, or of charity: that it is nothing short
of, or different from, the mind that was in Christ; the image of
God stamped upon the heart; inward righteousness, attended
with the peace of God and joy in the Holy Ghost. Secondly,
that the only way to this religion is repentance towards God,
and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. Thirdly, that by this
faith, he that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth
the ungodly, is justified freely by His grace through the
redemption which is in Christ Jesus. And, lastly, that being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
justified by faith, we taste of the heaven to which we are
going; we are holy and happy; we tread down sin and fear,
and sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>He further tells us that the reasons which induced him to
begin preaching in the open air were—1. That he was forbidden,
as by a general consent, though not by any judicial
sentence, to preach in any church. 2. That the rooms in
which he preached could not contain a tenth part of the people
that were earnest to hear. Hence, he adds, he determined to
do in England what he had often done in a warmer climate;
namely, when the house would not contain the congregation,
to preach in the open air; and never had he seen a more
awful sight than when, on Rose Green, or the top of Hannam
Mount, some thousands of people were calmly joined together
in solemn waiting upon God. He had no desire or design to
preach in the open air till he was forbidden to preach in
churches. It was no matter of choice, neither of premeditation.
Field preaching was a sudden expedient, a thing submitted to
rather than chosen; and submitted to, because he thought
preaching even thus better than not preaching at all; first, in
regard to his own soul, because a dispensation of the gospel
being committed to him, he did not dare not to preach the
gospel; and secondly, in regard to the souls of others, whom
he everywhere saw seeking death in the error of their life.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Some of his friends urged him to settle in college, or to
accept a cure of souls: to whom he replied:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have no business at college, having now no office and no pupils; and
it will be time enough to consider whether I ought to accept a cure of
souls when one is offered to me. On scriptural grounds, I do not think it
hard to justify what I am doing. God, in Scripture, commands me, according
to my power, to instruct the ignorant, reform the wicked, confirm the
virtuous. Man forbids me to do this in another’s parish; that is, in
effect, not to do it at all, seeing I have now no parish of my own, nor
probably ever shall. Whom then shall I hear? God or man? If it
be just to obey man rather than God, judge ye. I look upon all the
world as my parish; thus far I mean, that, in whatever part of it I am, I
judge it meet, right, and my bounden duty to declare unto all that are
willing to hear, the glad tidings of salvation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such was the position taken by Wesley and his friends.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Their chief, their only business was to save souls. For this
they had a world-wide commission. Nothing short of this
could satisfy the yearnings of their nature. Unlike the old
Puritans and others, they had no attacks to make on the
despotic measures of the court and Church. “In their bosoms
there was no rankling grudge against authorities; there was
no particle of that venom which, wherever it lodges, infects
and paralyses the religious affections.”<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Their sole quarrel
was, not with church or state authorities, but with sin and
Satan; and their sole object was, not to make proselytes, but
to save sinners.</p>

<p>Their congregations, says James Hutton, “were composed
of every description of persons, who, without the slightest
attempt at order, assembled, crying ‘Hurrah!’ with one
breath, and with the next bellowing and bursting into tears
on account of their sins; some poking each other’s ribs, and
others shouting ‘Hallelujah.’ It was a jumble of extremes of
good and evil; and so distracted alike were both preachers
and hearers, that it was enough to make one cry to God for
His interference. Here thieves, prostitutes, fools, people of
every class, several men of distinction, a few of the learned,
merchants, and numbers of poor people who had never
entered a place of worship, assembled in crowds and became
godly.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Of course, persecution followed. “We continued,” says
Wesley, “to call sinners to repentance in London, Bristol,
Bath, and a few other places; but it was not without violent
opposition, both from high and low, learned and unlearned.
Not only all manner of evil was spoken of us, both in private
and public, but the beasts of the people were stirred up almost
in all places to knock these mad dogs on the head at once.
And when complaint was made of their savage, brutal
violence, no magistrate would do us justice.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The following may be taken as specimens of the opposition
met with in 1739. On one occasion, Wesley had obtained
permission to preach in Pensford church; but, just as he was
setting out, he received a letter, saying that the minister had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
been informed that he was mad, and that, therefore, the permission
was withdrawn. Not being allowed to occupy the
church, Wesley took his stand in the open air; but in the
midst of prayer, two men, hired for the purpose, began to
sing ballads, which obliged Wesley and his friends to begin
to sing a psalm, so as to drown one noise by another.</p>

<p>Another incident must be given. Bath, at that period,
was perhaps the most fashionable city in England; and
the most renowned man in Bath was Richard, commonly
called “Beau,” Nash. This accomplished rake, now sixty-five
years old, was the son of a glass manufacturer in Wales, and
was expelled from Jesus College, Oxford, for his intrigues and
wild adventures. At the age of thirty, he was without a
fortune, and without talents for acquiring one; and hence, to
the end of life, became a gamester. The visit of Queen Anne
to Bath, in 1703, had made the city the favourite resort of
people of distinction, and, ever after, the amusements of the
place were put under the direction of a master of the ceremonies,
this sovereignty of the city being decreed to Nash by
all ranks of residents and visitors. King of Bath, he had
rules posted in the pump-room, from which even royalty
itself was not allowed to deviate. He prescribed the dresses
in which ladies and gentlemen were to appear at balls, and
imperatively fixed the number of dances to be danced. He
himself wore a monstrously large white hat, and usually
travelled in a post chaise, drawn by six grey horses, honoured
with outriders, footmen, French horns, and every other
appendage of a pretentious coxcomb. He lived by gambling,
and scattered money with as much indifference as he won it.
The city of which he was the dandy king was full of fashionable
rogues. “Nothing,” says the <i>Weekly Miscellany</i> of that
period, “nothing was to be seen in it but play and the preparations
for it. Persons of all characters, distinctions, and
denominations sat down to cards from morning till night, and
from night till morning; and those who disagreed in everything
else agreed in this.”</p>

<p>On visiting Bath, Wesley was told that Nash meant to
interfere, and was entreated not to attempt to preach. Wesley,
however, was not the man to yield to a swaggering rake. He
had gone to preach, and preach he would, and did; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
threatenings of Nash having made his congregation much
larger than was expected. Besides the poor, he had many of
the rich and great. Soon after Wesley began his sermon, the
“Beau,” in his immense white hat, appeared, and asked by what
authority he dared to do what he was doing now. Wesley
replied, “By the authority of Jesus Christ, conveyed to me by
him who is now Archbishop of Canterbury, when he laid his
hands upon me, and said, ‘Take thou authority to preach the
gospel.’” “But this,” said Nash, “is a conventicle, and
contrary to act of parliament.” “No,” answered Wesley,
“conventicles are seditious meetings; but here is no sedition:
therefore, it is not contrary to act of parliament.” “I say it
is,” cried the man of Bath; “and, besides, your preaching
frightens people out of their wits.” “Sir,” said Wesley, “did
you ever hear me preach?” “No.” “How then can you
judge of what you never heard?” “I judge,” he answered,
“by common report.” “Common report,” replied Wesley,
“is not enough. Give me leave to ask you, sir, is not your
name Nash?” “It is,” he said. “Sir,” retorted Wesley, “I
dare not judge of you by common report.” The master of
ceremonies was worsted, and, after a pause, simply asked
what the people wanted; upon which an old woman
begged Wesley to allow her to answer him, and, amid her
taunts, the resplendent king of the pump-room sneaked
away.</p>

<p>No wonder that the Methodists were opposed. Their
preaching, their doctrine, and their whole behaviour were
novel. “Being convinced,” writes Wesley, “of that important
truth, which is the foundation of all real religion, that ‘by
grace we are saved through faith,’ we immediately began declaring
it to others. Indeed, we could hardly speak of anything
else, either in public or private. It shone upon our minds
with so strong a light, that it was our constant theme. It was
our daily subject, both in verse and prose; and we vehemently
defended it against all mankind. But, in doing this, we were
assaulted and abused on every side. We were everywhere
represented as mad dogs, and treated accordingly. We were
stoned in the streets, and several times narrowly escaped with
our lives. In sermons, newspapers, and pamphlets of all
kinds, we were painted as unheard of monsters. But this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
moved us not; we went on testifying salvation by faith both
to small and great, and not counting our lives dear unto
ourselves, so we might finish our course with joy.”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Wesley here mentions the attacks made upon them by the
press. The following are specimens:—</p>

<p>The <i>Scots Magazine</i>, for 1739, remarks that “Whitefield
and the two Wesleys offend against the rules of the
Christian church, by preaching in opposition to the opinions
and instructions of the bishops.” “The Wesleys,” continues
this Scottish censor, “are more guilty than Whitefield, because
they are men of more learning, better judgment, and
cooler heads. Let them go over to their proper companies,
their favourites, the Dissenters, and utter their extemporary
effusions in a conventicle; but not be suffered in our churches
hypocritically to use our forms, which they despise. Let them
carry their spirit of delusion among their brethren, the
Quakers. Let them preach up their election and reprobation
doctrines among the Calvinists; and their solifidian tenets
among the Antinomians. Let not such bold movers of
sedition, and ringleaders of the rabble, to the disgrace of their
order, be regularly admitted into those pulpits which they
have taken with multitude and with tumult, or, as ignominiously,
by stealth.”</p>

<p>The clergy also began to bestir themselves. On Trinity
Sunday, a sermon on regeneration was preached in the parish
churches of Greenwich, and of St. Peter the Poor, London,
by the Rev. Ralph Skerret, D.D., chaplain to the Earl
of Grantham. The sermon, in 8vo, thirty-six pages, was
published; but is scarcely worth noticing. The Methodists,
however, are spoken of as “restless deceivers of the people,
who make it their daily business to fill the heads of the
ignorant and unwary with wild, perplexive notions.”</p>

<p>Another sermon, preached before the university of Oxford,
on August 5, by the Rev. John Wilder, M.A., rector of St.
Aldate’s, on “The Trial of the Spirits,” brands the Methodists
as “deceivers,” “babblers,” “insolent pretenders,” “men of
capricious humours, spiritual sleight, and canting craftiness,”
“novices in divinity,” casting “indecent, false, and un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>christian
reflections on the clergy,” “newfangled teachers,
setting up their own fantastic conceits, in opposition to the
authority of God, and so bigoted to their wild opinions, and
so puffed up with pride and vanity at the success of their
enthusiastic labours, that they all appear fully disposed to
maintain and defend their cause by more than spiritual
weapons, or to die martyrs for it.”</p>

<p>On the 14th of October, the Rev. Charles Wheatley, M.A.,
vicar of Furneux Pelham, Herts, preached in St. Paul’s
Cathedral, London, a sermon against the “new enthusiasts,”
on “St. John’s test of knowing Christ, and being born of
Him.” The sermon, with notes, was published, in 8vo,
thirty-one pages, but was not calculated to augment the fame
of the honest and zealous churchman, who had already given
to the public two important ritualistic works, entitled, “A
Rational Illustration of the Book of Common Prayer,” and
“An Historical Vindication of the Fifty-fifth Canon.” Mr.
Wheatley is less abusive than Mr. Wilder; but yet he thinks
it right to describe the Methodists as “rapturous enthusiasts,
preaching up unaccountable sensations, violent emotions, and
sudden changes;” and likewise “assuming to themselves,
upon all occasions, the peculiar language of the Holy Ghost;
equalling themselves to prophets and apostles; boasting of
immediate inspirations; and laying a blasphemous claim to
greater miracles than were ever wrought even by Christ
Himself.”</p>

<p>Another opponent, in 1739, was Henry Stebbing, a doctor
of divinity, a royal chaplain, and preacher to the Honourable
Society of Gray’s Inn. This gentleman published “A Caution
against Religious Delusion,” in the shape of “a sermon on the
New Birth: occasioned by the pretensions of the Methodists.”
In this comparatively temperate production, the Methodists
are charged with “vain and confident boastings, and with rash
uncharitable censures;” with “gathering tumultuous assemblies
to the disturbance of the public peace, and with setting
at nought all authority and rule;” with “intruding into other
men’s labours, and with encouraging abstinence, prayer, and
other religious exercises, to the neglect of the duties of our
station.” It is admitted that, when there are “so many
combinations for vice,” “religious societies for praying, read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>ing
(if not expounding) the Scriptures, and singing psalms
may be of use for the encouragement of virtue;” but the
danger is lest the laymen, who were heads or leaders of these
societies, should “grow opinionated of themselves and fond of
their own gifts, and should run into wild fancies until the pale
of the Church is too strait for them.” Before the end of the
year 1739, Stebbing’s sermon reached a sixth edition.</p>

<p>Another antagonist, more violent than Stebbing, was Joseph
Trapp, D.D., who published, in 1739, a pamphlet of sixty-nine
pages, entitled, “The Nature, Folly, Sin, and Danger
of being Righteous over-much; with a particular view to the
Doctrines and Practices of certain Modern Enthusiasts. Being
the substance of four discourses lately preached in the parish
churches of Christ Church and St. Lawrence Jewry, London;
and St. Martin’s in the Fields, Westminster. By Joseph
Trapp, D.D.”</p>

<p>In this notable production, it is stated that, “for laymen to
officiate in reading prayers to any assembly, except their own
families, is an encroachment upon the office of those who are
ordained to holy functions; and for them to expound or interpret
Scripture is neither laudable nor justifiable, but tends
to the confirmation, not the removal, of ignorance.” For “a
raw novice, though in holy orders” (like Whitefield), “to take
upon him, at his first setting out, to be a teacher, not only of
all the laity, in all parts of the kingdom, but of the teachers
themselves, the learned clergy, many of them learned before
he was born, is an outrage upon common decency and common
sense; the height of presumption, confidence, and self-sufficiency;
so ridiculous as to create the greatest laughter,
were it not so deplorable and detestable as to create the
greatest grief and abhorrence; especially when vast multitudes
are so sottish and wicked as, in a tumultuous manner,
to run madding after him.” Trapp insinuates that the
Methodists “teach such absurd doctrines, and second them
with such absurd practices, as to give countenance to the
lewd and debauched, the irreligious and profane. In their
own imagination, their errors are the height of wisdom, and
their vices the most perfect virtues. They think themselves
the greatest saints, when, in truth, they are under strong
delusion, in the bond of iniquity, and in the gall of bitterness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
They have set the nearest and dearest relations at variance;
disturbed the quiet of families; and thrown whole neighbourhoods
and parishes into confusion. They were half-dissenters
<i>in</i> the Church, and more dangerous <i>to</i> the Church, than those
who were total dissenters <i>from</i> it.” “Methodism was nothing
but a revival of the old fanaticism of the last century; when
all manner of madness was practised, and all manner of
villainy committed in the name of Christ.” Its disciples, “like
Solomon’s madman, cast firebrands, arrows, and death; and
send to hell (only because they are not of their own frantic
persuasion) millions of Christians much better than themselves.”</p>

<p>The author proceeds:—“For a clergyman of the Church of
England to pray and preach in the fields, in the country, or
in the streets of the city, is perfectly new, a fresh honour to
the blessed age in which we have the happiness to live. I am
ashamed to speak upon a subject, which is a reproach not
only to our Church and country, but to human nature itself.
Can it promote the Christian religion to turn it into riot,
tumult, and confusion? to make it ridiculous and contemptible,
and expose it to the scorn and scoffs of infidels
and atheists? To the prevalence of immorality and profaneness,
infidelity and atheism, is now added the pest of enthusiasm.
Our prospect is very sad and melancholy. Go
not after these impostors and seducers; but shun them as you
would the plague.”</p>

<p>Such are fair specimens of the four fiery sermons preached
by Dr. Trapp. Hypocrites, enthusiasts, novelists, ignes fatui,
and glaring meteors are the best names which this reverend
divine could find for the poor, peaceable, and persecuted
Methodists.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>Another clerical adversary was “Tristam Land, M.A., late
Fellow of Clare Hall, in Cambridge, Curate of St. James,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Garlickhith; and Lecturer of the united parishes of St.
Anthony and St. John Baptist.” His sixpenny pamphlet of
thirty pages was entitled, “A Letter to the Rev. Mr. Whitefield,
with a Letter addressed to the Religious Societies.”
Whitefield is attacked for teaching the doctrine, that many
are baptized without being born again; whereas Tristam
Land insists that, according to the teachings of the Church
of England, “all infants, at the time they are baptized, are
sanctified with the Holy Ghost; and that, though they may
afterwards depart from the grace given, and fall into sin, they
are not to be commanded to be baptized or born again a
second time; for to be born more than once, in a spiritual
sense, is just as impossible as to be born twice in a natural.
All that can be done in this matter is to use the several
means of grace; or, in one word, as the Scripture expresses
it, they must be renewed again by repentance.”</p>

<p>This reverend gentleman then proceeds to describe the
Methodists as “young quacks in divinity, running about the
city, and taking great pains to distract the common people,
and to break the peace and unity of the Church. They are
like vain persons, who think themselves handsome, and are apt
to despise others; for looking upon themselves as exquisite
pictures of holiness and as patterns of piety, they represent
us (the clergy) as dumb dogs, profane, and carnally minded.
They talk much of the pangs of the new birth, their inward
feelings, experiences, and spiritual miracles; but their faith is
an ill grounded assurance, their hope an unwarrantable presumption,
and their charity a censoriousness and a contempt
of their brethren of different sentiments to themselves.”</p>

<p>Good old Dr. Byrom, in a letter dated February 8, 1739,
says, “The book against Mr. Whitefield by Mr. Land is
thought a weak piece.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> No wonder.</p>

<p>Besides these, there was published “An Expostulatory
Letter to the Rev. Mr. Whitefield;” also an octavo pamphlet
of forty pages, entitled, “Observations and Remarks on Mr.
Seagrave’s conduct and writings, in which his answer to the
Rev. Dr. Trapp’s four sermons is more particularly considered.”
In this latter production, it is asserted that White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>field
sinks the house of God into a playhouse, and turns
religion to a farce; that prostitutes swarm at his meetings,
and there make merchandise as at a country fair; that his
congregations are such as crowd to a Smithfield show; and
that Whitefield himself is an enthusiast, a blasphemer, and a
wavering, wandering preacher of no establishment, but nearly
attached to the Dissenting communion, and blending his
sermons with a spice both of the Papist and Mahommedan.</p>

<p>In a “Faithful Narrative” of Whitefield’s life and character,
it is stated that numberless lies and false reports have been
raised in London to vilify his character, and to stigmatise his
followers; and he was now branded as a mercenary knave.
It was also reported that, in Georgia, he had been imprisoned
and personally chastised for making the people mad with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>An “Expostulatory Letter” to Whitefield, “and the rest
of his brethren, the Methodists of the Church of England,”
octavo, forty pages, and signed “E. B.,” charges them with
departing from the rubric in <i>sprinkling children</i> at baptism,
thus prostituting a holy ordinance, and substituting an insignificant,
unavailing thing, neither worthy of God, nor beneficial
to men. It also urges them to be <i>dipped</i> themselves, and
thus become exemplars to others.</p>

<p>Besides all these, an attack was made by a young man of
eight-and-twenty, curate of All Saints’, Bristol, the Rev. Josiah
Tucker, afterwards a doctor of divinity, and Dean of Gloucester.
In a Letter, dated June 14, 1739, he accuses Whitefield
of propagating “blasphemous and enthusiastic notions, which
struck at the root of all religion, and made it the jest of those
who sat in the seat of the scornful.” Wesley replied to this,
and concludes by advising Tucker not to meddle with controversy,
for his talents were not equal to its management. It
would only entangle and bewilder him more and more.
Besides, there was no pleasure in answering a man whose
head was not adapted to the right directing of disputes.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>The next onslaught was more authoritative and serious.
On August 1, 1739, Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London,
published his “Pastoral Letter,” of fifty-five pages, “to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
People of his Diocese; especially those of the two great cities
of London and Westminster: by way of Caution against
Lukewarmness on one hand, and Enthusiasm on the other.”
Two-thirds of this prelatical pamphlet are on enthusiasm,
and are levelled against the Methodists. Numerous extracts
are given from Whitefield’s Journal, to show—1. That these
enthusiasts claim to have <i>extraordinary communications</i> with
God, and more than ordinary assurances of a special <i>presence</i>
with them. 2. That they have a special and immediate
<i>mission</i> from God. 3. That they think and act under the
immediate guidance of a <i>Divine inspiration</i>. 4. That they
speak of their preaching and expounding, and the effects
of them, as the sole work of a <i>Divine power</i>. 5. That they
boast of sudden and surprising effects as wrought by the
<i>Holy Ghost</i> in consequence of their preaching. 6. That they
claim the spirit of <i>prophecy</i>. 7. That they speak of themselves
in the language, and under the character, of <i>apostles</i>
of Christ, and even of <i>Christ</i> Himself. 8. That they profess
to plant and propagate a <i>new gospel</i>, as unknown to the
generality of ministers and people, in a Christian country.
9. That they endeavour to justify their own <i>extraordinary</i>
methods of teaching, by casting unworthy reflections upon
the parochial clergy, as deficient in the discharge of their
duty, and not instructing their people in the true doctrines of
Christianity.</p>

<p>Thirteen days after the “Pastoral Letter” was published,
Whitefield wrote an answer to it, and, in a firm but quiet
and respectful way, replied to all the bishop’s allegations.
He concludes by charging Gibson with propagating a new
gospel, because he asserts, that “good works are a <i>necessary
condition</i> of our being justified in the sight of God.” He
maintains that <i>faith</i> is the only necessary condition, and
that <i>good works</i> are the necessary fruit and consequence.
“This,” he writes, “is the doctrine of Jesus Christ; this is
the doctrine of the Church of England; and it is, because
the generality of the clergy of the Church of England do not
preach this doctrine, that I am resolved, God being my helper,
to continue instant in season and out of season, to declare
it unto all men, let the consequences, as to my own private
person, be what they will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>If the bishop really believed his accusations to be true,
his pastoral is a model of meek writing. On the other hand,
Whitefield’s answer is one of the smartest productions of his
pen; its pith and point somewhat reminding us of the
terseness which characterized his friend Wesley.</p>

<p>While Whitefield was skirmishing with the Bishop of
London, Wesley was having a brush with the Bishop of
Bristol. First they discussed the subject of faith as the only
necessary condition of a sinner’s justification before God.
Then his lordship charged the Methodists with “a horrid
thing, a very horrid thing,” namely, “pretending to extraordinary
revelations and gifts of the Holy Ghost.” The
conversation concluded thus:—</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> “I hear you administer the sacrament in your
societies.”</p>

<p><i>Wesley.</i> “My lord, I never did yet; and I believe I never
shall.”</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> “I hear too, that many people fall into fits in
your societies, and that you pray over them.”</p>

<p><i>Wesley.</i> “I do so, my lord, when any show, by strong cries
and tears, that their soul is in deep anguish; and our prayer
is often heard.”</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> “Very extraordinary indeed! Well, sir, since you
ask my advice, I will give it freely. You have no business
here; you are not commissioned to preach in this diocese.
Therefore, I advise you to go hence.”</p>

<p><i>Wesley.</i> “My lord, my business on earth is, to do what
good I can. Wherever, therefore, I think I can do most good,
there must I stay, so long as I think so. At present, I think
I can do most good here; therefore, here I stay. Being
ordained a priest, by the commission I then received, I
am a priest of the church universal; and being ordained
as fellow of a college, I was not limited to any particular
cure, but have an indeterminate commission to preach the
word of God in any part of the Church of England. I
conceive not, therefore, that in preaching here by this commission
I break any human law. When I am convinced I do,
then it will be time to ask, shall I obey God or man? But if
I should be convinced in the meanwhile that I could advance
the glory of God and the salvation of souls, in any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
place more than in Bristol, in that hour, by God’s help,
I will go hence; which till then I may not do.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>About the same time, a pamphlet of ninety-six pages was
published, entitled, “The Life of the Rev. Mr. George
Whitefield, by an Impartial Hand.” Impartiality is pretended,
but hostility is seen. The object of the Life is evidently
to make the subject of it a mark for the shafts of
ridicule. Accounts are given of the fracas in St. Margaret’s
church, Westminster, on Sunday, February 4. There is
also “a method of confession drawn up for the use of the
women Methodists,” professedly taken from the original in
Whitefield’s or Wesley’s own handwriting, and with which, it
is alleged, the Deists are delighted. Among other questions,
to be asked, as often as occasion required, were the following:
“Are you in love? Whom do you love just now, better than
any other person in the world? Is not the person an idol?
Does any court you? How do you like him? How do you
feel yourself when he comes, when he stays, and when he
goes away?” A full account is, likewise, furnished of Joseph
Periam, a young clerk to an attorney, who had been converted,
partly by reading Whitefield’s sermons on the new birth, and
whom his friends had put into a madhouse—(1) Because he
fasted for near a fortnight. (2) Because he prayed so as to be
heard several storeys high. (3) Because he had sold his clothes
and given the money to the poor. The Methodists are
further charged with attempting to take away the liberty of
the press; Wesley is accused of placing his converts, when
delivered from their violent agitations and distortions, on an
eminence, for others to behold them; and Whitefield is
charged with saying, that he could produce two cobblers in
Bristol, that knew more of true Christianity than all the
clergy in the city put together. His Journals are designated
rhapsodies and repetitions of spiritual pride, vanity and nonsense;
he is accused of wilful and notorious falsehood, and of
taking pleasure in being abusive and scurrilous.</p>

<p>All this breathes fury; but the following taken from the
<i>Weekly Miscellany</i> of July 21, 1739, surpasses it. The
Methodist preacher stands on an eminence with admiring and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
subscribing crowds about him. He is young, which is good;
looks innocent, which is better; and has no human learning,
which is best of all. He spreads his hands and opens his lips
as wide as possible. He talks of a sensible new birth; good
women around him come to his assistance; he dilates himself;
cries out; the hill swells into a mountain; and <i>parturiunt
montes, nascitur ridiculus mus</i>. Then there is a chorus of
ten thousand sighs and groans, deepened with the blowing of
bassoons and horns. The Methodists are mad enthusiasts
who teach, for dictates of the Holy Spirit, seditions, heresies,
and contempt of the ordinances of God and man. They are
buffoons in religion, and mountebanks in theology; creatures
who disclaim sense and are below argument; visionary
antics in gowns and cassocks; so buffeted by the devil as
to be qualified to be confessors to the whole island; composing
sermons as fast as they can write, and speaking faster
than they think; and forming societies of females, who are
to confess their love affairs one to another, and to take care
that there shall be a supply of new Methodists for future
generations.</p>

<p>In the same year, appeared a pamphlet, of twenty-eight
pages, entitled “The Methodists; an Humorous, Burlesque
Poem, addressed to the Rev. Mr. Whitefield and his followers.”
The frontispiece represents the great preacher addressing an
immense crowd on Kennington Common, while, on the outskirts
of the congregation, are coaches of all descriptions, and
a gibbet on which three condemned felons are hanging. Describing
the Methodists, the poem says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“By rule they eat, by rule they drink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do all things else by rule, but think—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Accuse their priests of loose behaviour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To get more in the laymen’s favour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Method alone must guide ‘em all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence Methodists themselves they call.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After this, the devil is represented as making a tour from
Rome to Oxford, in the course of which he stole the bigoted
madness of a Turk, and the wit of a modern atheist, both of
which he drenched, dull and deep, in a literary Dutchman’s
brain, and then, making them his own, and pulling off his
horns, and shoeing his cloven foot, dressing himself in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
student’s gown, and using for the nonce a distorted face, and,
because of the piety of its nasal tones, a Noncon parson’s
nose, he introduced himself to the Oxford Methodists, and
gave them instructions how to act, so as to effect their purposes,—instructions
too lascivious to be reprinted. As a <i>very
mild</i> specimen of this foul-mouthed poem, we give another
description of the Methodists:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All men of thought with laughter view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or pity, the mistaken crew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, mad with Scripture, void of sense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thoughtless, novelists commence;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swerve from the rules of mother Church,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leave her basely in the lurch:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To holy <i>Holt</i> they all repair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There join in <i>folly</i> and in prayer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Next round the <i>gaols</i> they hovering fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To plague the wretches ere they die;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And while the children lisp their praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Bless ‘em!’ each good old woman says.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the risk of exhausting the reader’s patience, we must
notice another anti-Methodist pamphleteer, who, in 1739, did
his little best to strangle the new-born system at its birth.
This was a certain “James Bate, M.A., Rector of St. Paul’s,
Deptford; and formerly Chaplain to His Excellency Horatio
Walpole, Esq.”</p>

<p>First of all, the redoubtable author gave to the world a
pamphlet of thirty-eight pages, bearing the title, “Methodism
Displayed; or Remarks upon Mr. Whitefield’s Answer to the
Bishop of London’s Pastoral Letter.” In this production,
Whitefield is charged with causing numbers of poor tradesmen
to leave their families to starve, only to ramble after
himself; in dividing the word of God, he violently divides
text from context, and makes arrant nonsense of both; he
shuffles and prevaricates; treats the bishop with saucy sneers;
is guilty of flat falsehoods, disingenuous quirks, and mean
evasions; perfidiously tramples upon the canons of the
Church; and flies in the face of his diocesan with unparalleled
pride and impudence.</p>

<p>Not having exhausted all his wrath, the same reverend
gentleman, at the end of the year, issued another manifesto, of
sixty-six pages, entitled, “Quakero-Methodism; or a Confu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>tation
of the First Principles of the Quakers and Methodists.”
This was a dear shilling’s worth, written in reply to a letter
on Bate’s former pamphlet “by T. S—— y, Esq.” Bate
asserts that the whole performance of the “Quakero-Methodist”
(as T. S—— y is called) may be ranked under the
two heads of scurrility and sophistry; but as God, at whose
altar he serves, has forbid him to return railing for railing,
he will give no answer to the scurrility whatever. He then,
notwithstanding this, proceeds to accuse his adversary of
having “troubled the public with a load of stupidity, folly,
and nonsense.” He alleges against him “insipid sneers, like
the grins of an idiot;” he tells him that “the shortest cut for
him to avoid writing nonsense is to lay down his pen;” that
his “whole stock of knowledge has been laid in at some
expounding house that was under the influence of the spirit
of presumption, ignorance, pride, and arrogance;” and that
“his arguments have never more than two gentle faults, false
premises and a false conclusion.” He says, Whitefield
“chews” the charges of the Bishop of London, “just as an
ass mumbles a thistle, without either the courage to swallow
it, or the sense to lay it down;” and concludes by assuring his
opponent that he could have “goaded him with the sharpest,
bitterest, and severest sarcasms, and have scourged his
spiritual pride with wholesome severity;” but in mercy he
has refrained from using such “a whip of scorpions.”</p>

<p>The magazines and newspapers of the period were filled
with similar abuse of the poor Methodists. The writer has
examined most of them, and has been struck with two
facts:—(1) of those admitting letters and articles against the
Methodists, the fairest and most moderate was the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>; and (2) the bitterest and most violent was the
professedly religious <i>Weekly Miscellany</i>, a weekly folio sheet
of four pages. The following is a mild specimen from the
latter, and refers not only to the movements of Wesley and
Whitefield in the south of England, but of Ingham in the
north. After accusing Whitefield of “behaviour disgraceful
to the Christian religion and to the ministerial office,” the
journalist proceeds to say that—</p>

<p>“The clergy had all refused him their pulpits, and the lord
mayor the halls and markets of the city.” He was “a con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>ceited
boaster and heterodox intruder; whose next performance
was to be accompanied with a chorus of ten thousand
sighs and groans, deepened with bassoons. In the approaching
winter, the town would be entertained with harlequin
turned Methodist, by way of reprisals, since the Methodist
had turned harlequin. In Yorkshire, by the preaching of the
Methodists, the spirit of enthusiasm had so prevailed, that
almost every man who could hammer out a chapter in the
Bible had turned an expounder of the Scripture, to the great
decay of industry, and the almost ruin of the woollen manufacture,
which seemed threatened with destruction for want of
hands to work it.” “Methodism has laid aside play-books
and poems, for Scripture phrases and hymns of its own composing.
Its disciples were never easy but when they were in
a church, or expounding the Bible, which they could do offhand,
from Genesis to Revelation, with great ease and power.
They had given away their finery to tattered beggars,
resolving to wear the coarsest attire and to live upon the
most ordinary diet. They hired barns, where they met at six
in the evening; expounded, prayed, and sang psalms till
towards ten; and then had a lovefeast to communicate their
experiences, especially as to love affairs.” “Several fine
ladies, who used to wear French silks, French hoops of four
yards wide, bob-wigs, and white satin smock petticoats, were
turned Methodists, and now wore stuff gowns, common night-mobs,
and plain bays for <i>Jennys</i>.”</p>

<p>Numbers of similar extracts might be given from the newspapers
and periodicals of 1739; but the reader has had
enough of scurrilous and lying hodge-podge to satisfy the
cravings of the greatest gossip.</p>

<p>Such were the premonitory mutterings of the storm in
which the Methodist movement was cradled. Mobs
threatened; newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals
fulminated their malicious squibs; prelates, priests, and
doctors of divinity became militant pamphleteers; but, in the
midst of all, Wesley and his friends calmly proceeded in their
glorious calling. Some even, who were animated with a
friendly feeling towards them, looked upon their course of
conduct with alarm. Good Dr. Doddridge, in a letter dated
May 24, 1739, writes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think the Methodists sincere; I hope some may be reformed, instructed,
and made serious by their means. I saw Mr. Whitefield
preaching on Kennington Common last week to an attentive multitude,
and heard much of him at Bath; but, supposing him sincere and in good
earnest, I still fancy that he is but a <i>weak</i> man—much too positive, says
rash things, and is bold and enthusiastic. I am most heartily glad to
hear that any <i>real</i> good is done anywhere to the souls of men; but
whether these Methodists are in a right way—whether they are warrantable
in all their conduct,—whether <i>poor</i> people should be urged,
through different persons successively, to pray from four in the morning
till eleven at night, is not clear to me; and I am less satisfied with the
high pretences they make to the Divine influence. I think what Mr.
Whitefield says and does comes but little short of an assumption of
inspiration or infallibility.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another friend, Mr. T. Hervey, writing in the same month
to Samuel Wesley, at Tiverton, says, that he is anxious “to
stop the spread and prevalence of several very strange and
pestilent opinions;” and expresses the hope that this may
be done effectually by the elder brother of Wesley, whom he
designates “the dear, but deluded man.” He then proceeds
to state that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These pestilent opinions are—1. That the method of education, the
distinction, order, degrees, and even robes and habits of the university
are all anti-Christian. 2. That nothing is taught in it but learning which
opposes the power of God. 3. That whoso is born of God is also taught of
God, not in any limited sense, but so as to render the use of all natural
means of no effect. 4. That all human learning, however said to be
sanctified of God, entirely disqualifies a man from preaching the true
gospel of Jesus Christ. 5. That none have a right to preach, but such as
are immediately called to it by the Holy Ghost. 6. That an established
ministry is a mere invention of man. 7. That the Church of England and
all its authority are founded on and supported by a lie; and that all who
receive a power of preaching from it are in a state of slavery.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This was a kind and well meant letter, but it was pregnant
with mistakes. Still it tends to show the enormous difficulties
encountered by the Methodists at the commencement
of their history. Sometimes they met a friend, though not
often; and it is a pleasing duty to introduce godly Joseph
Williams, of Kidderminster, as one who sympathised with
their indefatigable endeavours to save the souls of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
fellow men. Under the date of September 17, 1739, he writes
concerning the two Wesleys, Whitefield, and Ingham:—</p>

<p>“The common people flock to hear them, and, in most
places, hear them gladly. They commonly preach once or
twice every day; and expound the Scriptures in the evening
to religious societies, who have their society rooms for that
purpose.” He then proceeds to give an account of his
hearing Charles Wesley preach at Bristol. Standing on
a table, in a field, the preacher, with eyes and hands lifted
up to heaven, prayed with uncommon fervour and fluency.
“He then preached about an hour in such a manner as I
scarce ever heard any man preach. Though I have heard
many a finer sermon, yet I think I never heard any man
discover such evident signs of vehement desire” [to benefit
his hearers]. “With unusual fervour, he acquitted himself
as an ambassador for Christ; and although he used no notes,
nor had anything in his hand but a Bible, yet he delivered
his thoughts in a rich, copious variety of expression, and with
so much propriety, that I could not observe anything
incoherent through the whole performance, which he concluded
with singing, prayer, and the usual benediction.</p>

<p>“Afterward, I waited on him at Mr. Norman’s. He received
me in a very friendly manner. Before he would take any
refreshment, he, with a few friends that waited on him,
sung a hymn, and then prayed for a blessing, as at set meals.
After tea, we sung another hymn; and then I went with them
to the religious society, and found the place so thronged,
that it was with great difficulty we reached the centre of
it. We found them singing a hymn; he then prayed; and
proceeded to expound the twelfth chapter of the gospel of
St. John, in a sweet, savoury, spiritual manner. This was
followed by singing another hymn; and he then prayed over
a great number of bills presented by the society, about
twenty of which respected spiritual cases. Never did I
hear such praying. Never did I see or hear such evident
marks of fervency in the service of God. At the close of
every petition, a serious Amen, like a gentle, rushing sound of
waters, ran through the whole audience. Such evident marks
of a lively fervent devotion, I was never witness to before.
If there be such a thing as heavenly music upon earth, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
heard it there. I do not remember my heart to have been
so elevated in Divine love and praise, as it was there and
then, for many years past, if ever. Notwithstanding some
errors, which, as mere men, they may be liable to, I cannot
but believe that God is with them of a truth, and hath raised
them up in this day of general defection from gospel purity,
simplicity, and zeal, for signal service and usefulness in
His church.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>In a letter to Charles Wesley, written in the month of
September, 1739, Williams adds: “I heartily wish you God
speed. I bless you in the name of the Lord. Fear not
what men can do unto you. With Him your judgment is,
and your reward with your God.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Such a testimony from a man so devout, enlightened,
and justly famed as Joseph Williams, the Kidderminster
carpet weaver, is quite as weighty as any testimony of an
opposite character from either Bishop Gibson, or any priest
or prelate then watching on the walls of Zion.</p>

<p>We must now return to Wesley at Bristol. Every night he
expounded to societies. These were small gatherings of
religious people, which had continued meeting for godly
purposes for about the last fifty years;<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> for it is important
to remember that the “Religious Societies” formed in the
days of Dr. Horneck, previous to the abdication of King
James, and again revived in the reign of Queen Mary, were
not confined to London and Westminster, but existed in
different towns throughout the kingdom. We find them
in Oxford, Nottingham, Gloucester, Bristol, Newcastle,
Dublin, Kilkenny, and other places; and all acting substantially
according to the same rules and regulations. They
met to pray, sing psalms, and read the Scriptures together;
and to reprove, exhort, and edify one another by religious
conference. They also carried out designs of charity, such
as supporting lectures and daily prayers in churches, releasing
imprisoned debtors, and relieving the poor and sending
their children to school. In 1737, Whitefield preached “a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
sermon before the “Religious Societies” at one of their general
quarterly meetings in Bow church, London, from the text,
Ecclesiastes iv. 9‒12, in which he strongly advocated the
practice of Christians meeting together for religious fellowship.
“As coals,” says he, “if placed asunder, soon go out, but if
heaped together, enliven each other, and afford a lasting
heat;” so it is with Christians.</p>

<p>Such were the “Religious Societies” which existed for more
than half-a-century before the formation of the “United
Societies” of the people called Methodists; and in whose
rooms and meetings, in London, Bristol, and elsewhere, Whitefield
and the Wesley brothers, for a few years, were accustomed
to read and explain the Scriptures almost every night.
On arriving in Bristol, Wesley found such societies as these
assembling in Castle Street, in Gloucester Lane, in Weavers’ Hall, in Nicholas Street, in the Back Lane, and in Baldwin
Street, and at once began expounding to them the Epistle to
the Romans, and other portions of the New Testament; and
it is a remarkable fact that, with one or two exceptions, all
the scenes about to be mentioned took place in these society
meetings, or in private dwellings. We furnish them as we
find them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>April 17. At Baldwin Street, we called upon God to confirm His
word. Immediately, one that stood by cried out aloud, with the utmost
vehemence, even as in the agonies of death. But we continued in prayer,
till a new song was put into her mouth, a thanksgiving unto our God.
Soon after, two other persons were seized with strong pain, and constrained
to roar for the disquietude of their heart. But it was not
long before they likewise burst forth into praise to God their Saviour.
The last who called upon God, as out of the belly of hell, was a stranger
in Bristol; and, in a short space, he also was overwhelmed with joy
and love, knowing that God had healed his backslidings.</p>

<p>April 21. At Weavers’ Hall, a young man was suddenly seized with
a violent trembling all over, and, in a few minutes, sunk to the ground.
But we ceased not calling upon God, till He raised him up full of peace
and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>April 24. At Baldwin Street, a young man, after a sharp though short
agony, both of body and mind, found his soul filled with peace, knowing
in whom he had believed.</p>

<p>April 26. At Newgate, I was led to pray that God would bear
witness to His word. Immediately one, and another, and another
sunk to the earth; they dropped on every side as thunderstruck. One
of them cried aloud. We besought God in her behalf, and He</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>turned her heaviness into joy. A second being in the same agony,
we called upon God for her also; and He spoke peace unto her soul.
In the evening, one was so wounded by the sword of the Spirit,
that you would have imagined she could not live a moment. But
immediately His abundant kindness was shown, and she loudly sang
of His righteousness.</p>

<p>April 27. All Newgate rang with the cries of those whom the word
of God cut to the heart; two of whom were in a moment filled with
joy, to the astonishment of those that beheld them.</p>

<p>April 30. While I was preaching at Newgate, a woman broke out
into strong cries and tears. Great drops of sweat ran down her face, and
all her bones shook; but both her body and soul were healed in a
moment.</p>

<p>May 1. At Baldwin Street, my voice could scarce be heard amidst
the groanings of some, and the cries of others calling aloud to Him
that is mighty to save; and ten persons then began to say in faith,
“My Lord and my God!” A Quaker, who stood by, was very angry,
and was biting his lips, and knitting his brows, when he dropped
down as thunderstruck. The agony he was in was even terrible
to behold. We prayed for him, and he soon lifted up his head
with joy, and joined us in thanksgiving. A bystander, John Haydon,
a weaver, a man of regular life and conversation, one that constantly
attended the public prayers and sacrament, and was zealous for the
Church, and against Dissenters, laboured to convince the people that
all this was a delusion of the devil; but next day, while reading a
sermon on “Salvation by Faith,” he suddenly changed colour, fell off
his chair, and began screaming, and beating himself against the ground.
The neighbours were alarmed, and flocked together. When I came
in, I found him on the floor, the room being full of people, and two or
three holding him as well as they could. He immediately fixed his eyes
on me, and said, “Ay, this is he I said deceived the people. But
God has overtaken me. I said it was a delusion of the devil; but
this is no delusion.” Then he roared aloud, “O thou devil! thou cursed
devil! yea, thou legion of devils! thou canst not stay in me. Christ will
cast thee out. I know His work is begun. Tear me in pieces, if thou
wilt; but thou canst not hurt me.” He then beat himself against the
ground; his breast heaving, as if in the pangs of death, and great drops of
sweat trickling down his face. We all betook ourselves to prayer. His
pangs ceased, and both his body and soul were set at liberty. With a
clear, strong voice, he cried, “This is the Lord’s doing; and it is
marvellous in our eyes. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from this
time forth for evermore.” I called again an hour after. We found his
body weak as that of an infant, and his voice lost; but his soul was
in peace, full of love, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The
women of our society met at seven, and, during prayer, one of them fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
into a violent agony; but soon after began to cry out, with confidence,
“My Lord and my God.”</p>

<p>May 12. In the evening, three persons, almost at once, sunk down as
dead, having all their sins set in array before them; but, in a short time,
they were raised up, and knew that the Lamb of God, who taketh away
the sin of the world, had taken away their sins.</p>

<p>May 16. While I was declaring at Baptist Mills, “He was wounded
for our transgressions,” a middle aged man began violently beating
his breast. During our prayer, God put a new song into his mouth.</p>

<p>May 19. At Weavers’ Hall, a woman first, and then a boy, was
overwhelmed with sin, and sorrow, and fear. But we cried to God,
and their souls were delivered.</p>

<p>May 20. In the evening God spoke to three whose souls were all
storm and tempest, and immediately there was a great calm.</p>

<p>May 21. Although the people had seen signs and wonders, yet many
would not believe. They could not, indeed, deny the facts; but they
could explain them away. Some said, “These were purely natural effects;
the people fainted away only because of the heat and closeness of the
rooms.” Others were “sure it was all a cheat; they might help it if they
would. Else why were these things only in their private societies?”
To-day, our Lord answered for Himself; for, while I was preaching,
He began to make bare His arm, not in a close room, neither in private,
but in the open air, and before more than two thousand witnesses. One,
and another, and another were struck to the earth; exceedingly trembling
at the presence of His power. Others cried, with a loud and bitter cry,
“What must we do to be saved?” And, in less than an hour, seven persons,
wholly unknown to me till that time, were rejoicing, and singing, and, with
all their might, giving thanks to the God of their salvation. In the
evening, at Nicholas Street, I was interrupted, almost as soon as I had
begun to speak, by the cries of one who strongly groaned for pardon and
peace. Others dropped down as dead. Thomas Maxfield began to roar
out, and beat himself against the ground, so that six men could scarcely
hold him. Except John Haydon, I never saw one so torn of the evil one.
Many others began to cry out to the Saviour of all, insomuch that all
the house, and, indeed, all the street for some space, was in an uproar.
But we continued in prayer, and the greater part found rest to their souls.
I think twenty-nine in all had their heaviness turned into joy this day.</p>

<p>June 15. At Wapping (London), many of those that heard began to
call upon God with strong cries and tears. Some sunk down, and there
remained no strength in them; others exceedingly trembled and quaked;
some were torn with a kind of convulsive motion in every part of their
bodies; and that so violently, that often four or five persons could not
hold one of them. I have seen many hysterical and many epileptic fits;
but none of them were like these, in many respects. One woman was
greatly offended, being sure they might help it if they would; but she
also dropped down in as violent an agony as the rest. Twenty-six of
those who had been thus affected were filled with peace and joy.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>June 16. At Fetter Lane, some fell prostrate on the ground; others
burst out into loud praise and thanksgiving; and many openly testified,
there had been no such day as this since January the first preceding.</p>

<p>June 22. In the society (Bristol) one before me dropped down as
dead, and presently a second, and a third. Five others sunk down in
half an hour, most of whom were in violent agonies. In their trouble, we
called upon the Lord, and He gave us an answer of peace. All, except
one, went away rejoicing and praising God.</p>

<p>June 23. This evening another was seized with strong pangs; but
in a short time her soul was delivered.</p>

<p>June 24. In the evening, a girl and four or five other persons were
deeply convinced of sin; and, with sighs and groans, called upon God for
deliverance.</p>

<p>June 25. About ten in the morning J—— e C—— r, as she was sitting
at her work, was suddenly seized with grievous terrors of mind, attended
with strong trembling; but, at the society in the evening, God turned her
heaviness into joy. Five or six others were also cut to the heart this
day; and, soon after, found Him whose hands made whole.</p>

<p>June 26. Three persons terribly felt the wrath of God abiding on them
at the society this evening. But, upon prayer being made on their behalf,
He was pleased soon to lift up the light of His countenance upon them.</p>

<p>June 30. At Weavers’ Hall, seven or eight persons were constrained
to roar aloud; but they were all relieved upon prayer, and sang praises
unto our God, and unto the Lamb that liveth for ever and ever.</p>

<p>July 1. A young woman sunk down at Rose Green in a violent
agony both of body and mind: as did five or six persons, in the evening,
at the new room, at whose cries many were greatly offended. The same
offence was given in the morning by one at Weavers’ Hall; and by eight
or nine others at Gloucester Lane in the evening.</p>
</div>

<p>Here we pause. On June 25, Whitefield wrote to Wesley
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,—I cannot think it right in you to give so much
encouragement to those convulsions which people have been thrown into,
under your ministry. Was I to do so, how many would cry out every
night? I think it is tempting God to require such signs. That there is
something of God in it, I doubt not. But the devil, I believe, interposes.
I think it will encourage the French Prophets, take people from the
written word, and make them depend on visions, convulsions, etc., more
than on the promises and precepts of the gospel.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Twelve days after, Whitefield was in Bristol, and Wesley
wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“July 7. I had an opportunity to talk with Mr. Whitefield of those
outward signs which had so often accompanied the work of God. I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
his objections were chiefly grounded on gross misrepresentations of
matters of fact. But next day he had an opportunity of informing himself
better; for, in the application of his sermon, four persons sunk down close
to him, almost in the same moment. One of them lay without either
sense or motion. A second trembled exceedingly. The third had strong
convulsions all over his body, but made no noise, unless by groans. The
fourth, equally convulsed, called upon God, with strong cries and tears.
From this time, I trust, we shall all suffer God to carry on His own work
in the way that pleaseth Him.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was an important crisis. Without expressing any
opinion respecting these “signs,” as Wesley calls them, we
cannot but admire Wesley’s wish and hope that God may be
allowed to work His own work in His own way. Of all men
living, Wesley was one of the least likely to desire novelties
like these; but he was wise enough, and reverent enough, not
to interpose when God was working, and to say, that, unless
the work was done after a certain fashion, he should object
to its being done at all. Some, in modern times, have been
in danger of doing this. Sinners have been undeniably
converted; but because they have not been converted at the
times, or in the places, or by the instrumentalities which men
have chosen to commend, they have objected to such conversions,
and tacitly desired not to have them multiplied.
This was not Wesley’s way. He was one of the greatest
sticklers for church order and religious decorum; but he
was not the man to protest, that, unless God’s work was
carried on in accordance with his own predilections, he should
object to it altogether. His words are golden ones, and
worth remembering by all his followers:—“<i>From this time,
I trust, we shall all suffer God to carry on His own work in
the way that pleaseth Him.</i>”</p>

<p>Whitefield’s objections were silenced. He came, he saw,
and he was conquered. He writes, under date of July 7:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I had a useful conference about many things with my honoured friend
Mr. John Wesley. I found that Bristol had great reason to bless God for
his ministry. The congregations I observed to be much more serious
and affected than when I left them; and their loud and repeated Amens,
which they put up to every petition, as well as the exemplariness of their
conversation in common life, plainly show that they have not received the
grace of God in vain. Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky;
but how is it that ye cannot discern the signs of these times? That good,
great good, is done is evident. What is it but little less than blasphemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
against the Holy Ghost to impute this great work to delusion, and to
the power of the devil?”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We resume Wesley’s notices of what he designates the
“signs” of the work of God.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>July 23. On several evenings this week many were deeply convinced;
but none were delivered from that painful conviction. I fear we have
grieved the Spirit of the jealous God, by questioning His work; and that,
therefore, He is withdrawn from us for a season. But He will return and
abundantly pardon.</p>

<p>July 30. Two more were in strong pain, both their souls and bodies
being well-nigh torn asunder. But, though we cried unto God, there
was no answer. One of them cried aloud, though not articulately,
for twelve or fourteen hours; when her soul was set at liberty. She was a
servant, and her master forbid her returning to his service, saying, he
would have none in his house who had received the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>August 5. Six persons at the new room were deeply convinced of
sin; three of whom were a little comforted by prayer.</p>

<p>August 11. In the evening two were seized with strong pangs, as
were four the next evening, and the same number at Gloucester Lane
on Monday; one of whom was greatly comforted.</p>

<p>August 14. Three at the new room this evening were cut to the
heart; but their wound was not as yet healed.</p>
</div>

<p>A fortnight after this, Charles Wesley came to Bristol,
and John removed to London. The work still progressed
at Bristol. In one instance, a woman screamed for mercy,
so as to drown Charles’s voice. On another occasion, he
“heard on all sides the sighing of them that were in captivity.”
“The Lord added to the church daily.”</p>

<p>In London, numbers had been converted under the ministry
of Charles Wesley, Whitefield, and others; but there is no
evidence to show that there had been any “convulsions”
like those at Bristol. It is also a curious fact, that, though
Wesley’s preaching on Kennington Common, in Moorfields,
and in other places in the metropolis, was crowned with great
success, there were hardly any instances of paralysing
paroxysms analogous to those already mentioned. When he
returned to Bristol, in October, we find a renewal of such
cases.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>October 11. A woman showed the agony of her soul by crying aloud
to God for help. She continued in great torment all night; but, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
we were praying for her in the morning, God delivered her out of her
distress.</p>

<p>October 12. I was under some concern, with regard to one or two
persons, who were tormented in an unaccountable manner; and seemed
to be indeed lunatic, as well as sore vexed.</p>

<p>October 23. I was pressed to visit a young woman at Kingswood.
I found her on the bed, two or three persons holding her. Anguish,
horror, and despair, above all description, appeared in her pale face.
The thousand distortions of her whole body showed how the dogs of hell
were gnawing at her heart. The shrieks intermixed were scarce to be
endured. She screamed out, “I am damned, damned; lost for ever!
Six days ago you might have helped me. But it is past. I am the devil’s
now, I have given myself to him: his I am, him I must serve, with
him I must go to hell; I will be his, I will serve him, I will go with him
to hell; I cannot be saved, I will not be saved. I must, I will, I will be
damned!” She then begun praying to the devil. We began,—“Arm of
the Lord, awake, awake!” She immediately sank down as asleep; but, as
soon as we left off, broke out again, with inexpressible vehemence: “Stony
hearts, break! I am a warning to you. Break, break, poor stony hearts!
I am damned, that you may be saved. You need not be damned, though
I must.” She then fixed her eyes on the corner of the ceiling, and said,
“There he is. Come, good devil, come. You said you would dash my
brains out: come, do it quickly. I am yours, I will be yours.” We interrupted
her by calling again upon God; on which she sunk down as
before: and another young woman began to roar out as loud as she had
done. My brother now came in, it being about nine o’clock. We continued
in prayer till past eleven; when God, in a moment, spoke peace
into the soul, first of the first tormented, and then of the other. And they
both joined in singing praise to Him who had “stilled the enemy and the
avenger.”</p>

<p>October 25. I was sent for to one in Bristol, who was taken ill the
evening before. She lay on the ground furiously gnashing her teeth, and
after awhile roared aloud. It was not easy for three or four persons to
hold her, especially when the name of Jesus was named. We prayed;
the violence of her symptoms ceased, though without a complete deliverance.
In the evening, I was sent for to her again. She began screaming
before I came into the room; then broke out into a horrid laughter, mixed
with blasphemy. One, who apprehended a preternatural agent to be concerned
in this, asking, “How didst thou dare to enter into a Christian?”
was answered, “She is not a Christian—she is mine.” This was followed
by fresh trembling, cursing, and blaspheming. My brother coming in,
she cried out, “Preacher! Field preacher! I don’t love field preaching.”
This was repeated two hours together, with spitting, and all the expressions
of strong aversion. We left her at twelve, and called again at noon
next day. And now it was, that God showed He heareth prayer. All her
pangs ceased in a moment: she was filled with peace, and knew that the
son of wickedness was departed from her.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>October 27. I was sent for to Kingswood again, to one of those
who had been so ill before. A violent rain began just as I set out. Just
at that time, the woman (then three miles off) cried out, “Yonder comes
Wesley, galloping as fast as he can.” When I was come, she burst into
a horrid laughter, and said, “No power, no power; no faith, no faith.
She is mine; her soul is mine. I have her, and will not let her go.” We
begged of God to increase our faith. Meanwhile, her pangs increased
more and more; so that one would have imagined, by the violence of the
throes, her body must have been shattered to pieces. One, who was
clearly convinced this was no natural disorder, said, “I think Satan is let
loose. I fear he will not stop here,” and added, “I command thee in the
name of the Lord Jesus, to tell if thou hast commission to torment any
other soul.” It was immediately answered, “I have. L——y C——r and
S——h J——s.” We betook ourselves to prayer again; and ceased not,
till she began, with a clear voice, and composed, cheerful look, to sing,
“Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reader must be told that L——y C——r and S——h
J——s lived at some distance, and, at the time, were in perfect
health. The day after, they were affected in the same way
as the poor creature just delivered. Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>October 28. I called at Mrs. J——s’, in Kingswood. L——y C——r
and S——h J——s were there. It was scarce a quarter of an hour before
the former fell into a strange agony; and, presently after, the latter. The
violent convulsions all over their bodies were such as words cannot describe.
Their cries and groans were too horrid to be borne; till one of
them, in a tone not to be expressed, said, “Where is your faith now?
Come, go to prayers. I will pray with you.” We took the advice, and
poured out our souls before God, till L——y C——r’s agonies so increased,
that it seemed she was in the pangs of death. But, in a moment, God
spoke; and both her body and soul were healed. We continued in prayer
till past midnight, when S——h J——s’ voice was also changed, and she
began to call upon God. This she did for the greatest part of the night.
In the morning, we renewed our prayers, while she was crying continually,
“I burn! I burn! O what shall I do? I have a fire within me. I cannot
bear it. Lord Jesus! help! Amen, Lord Jesus!”</p>
</div>

<p>A few other cases occurred in 1739; and, notably, one on
November 30, when seven persons were grievously tormented,
and Wesley and his friends continued in prayer from the time
of evening service till nine o’clock next morning, that is, for
about fifteen hours, a case almost unparalelled in the history
of the church of Christ.</p>

<p>These are strange and mysterious facts; and, what adds to
the strangeness, is that, excepting the cases in London, on
June 15, 16, and September 17, 18, all of them occurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
in Bristol and its immediate neighbourhood. During the
space of time which these extracts cover, Wesley preached at
Bath, Kennington Common, Moorfields, Blackheath, Gloucester,
Bradford, Wells, Oxford, and in several towns in Wales,
and other places; but scenes like those above described were
never witnessed except in Bristol. It is also a curious circumstance,
that, though the preaching of Charles Wesley and of
Whitefield was quite as faithful as the preaching of Wesley
himself, and was far more impassioned, yet no such “signs”
seem to have been attendant on their ministry as were attendant
on his. Similar effects sometimes followed the preaching
of Cennick, during Wesley’s absence in London, but these
occurred also either at Kingswood or in Bristol. Writing to
Wesley under date of September 12, 1739, he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On Monday night, I was preaching at the school on the forgiveness
of sins, when numbers cried out with a loud and bitter cry. Indeed, it
seemed that the devil and the powers of darkness were come among
us. My mouth was stopped. The cries were terrifying. It was pitch
dark; it rained much; and the wind blew vehemently. Large flashes of
lightning and loud claps of thunder mingled with the screams and exclamations
of the people. The hurry and confusion cannot be expressed.
The whole place seemed to resemble the habitation of apostate spirits;
many raving up and down, and crying, ‘The devil will have me; I am
his servant! I am damned! My sins can never be pardoned! I am
gone, gone for ever!’ A young man was in such horrors, that seven or
eight persons could scarce hold him. He roared like a dragon: ‘Ten
thousand devils, millions, millions of devils are about me!’ This continued
three hours, and what a power reigned amongst us! Some cried
out with a hollow voice, ‘Mr. Cennick! Bring Mr. Cennick!’ I came
to all that desired me. They then spurned me with all their strength,
grinding their teeth, and expressing all the fury that heart can conceive.
Their eyes were staring and their faces swollen, and several have since
told me, that when I drew near, they felt fresh rage, and longed to tear
me in pieces. I never saw the like, nor even the shadow of it before.
Yet I was not in the least afraid, as I knew God was on our side.”<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such are the facts; nothing has been distorted, and nothing
kept back. They were occasionally repeated after the year
1739, but not often. A few cases subsequently occurred in
Bristol, and also in London, and in Newcastle; but nearly
all related in Wesley’s Journals are contained in the extracts
already given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>What shall be said concerning them? For a hundred and
thirty years, they have been sneered at by Wesley’s enemies,
and have also puzzled Wesley’s friends. No such results attended
Whitefield’s ministry, and Whitefield himself regarded
them with suspicion and dislike. Charles Wesley, at Newcastle,
in 1743, did his utmost to discourage them. He
writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many, no doubt, were, at our first preaching, struck down, both soul
and body, into the depth of distress. Their <i>outward affections</i> were easy
to be imitated. Many counterfeits I have already detected. The first
night I preached here, half my words were lost through their outcries.
Last night, before I began, I gave public notice that whosoever cried, so
as to drown my voice, should be carried to the farthest corner of the
room. But my porters had no employment the whole night; yet the
Lord was with us, mightily convincing of sin and of righteousness. I am
more and more convinced, the fits were a device of Satan to stop the
course of the gospel.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Samuel Wesley was in great doubt respecting them, and, in
a letter dated September 3, 1739, asks:—“Did these agitations
ever begin during the use of any collects of the Church? or
during the preaching of any sermon that had before been
preached within consecrated walls without effect? or during
the inculcating any other doctrine besides that of your new
birth?”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Ralph Erskine wrote to Wesley thus: “Some of
the instances you give seem to be exemplified, in the outward
manner, by the cases of Paul and the gaoler, as also Peter’s
hearers (Acts ii.). The last instance you give of some struggling
as in the agonies of death, is to me somewhat more
inexplicable, if it do not resemble the child of whom it is said,
that ‘when he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down
and tore him.’ I make no question, Satan, so far as he gets
power, may exert himself on such occasions, partly to mar
and hinder the beginning of the good work, in the persons
that are touched with the sharp arrows of conviction; and
partly also to prevent the success of the gospel on others.
However, the merciful issue of these conflicts, in the conversion
of the persons thus affected, is the main thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Erskine proceeds to state, that they have something, in
Scotland, analogous to what had occurred in Bristol. Sometimes
a whole congregation, in a flood of tears, would cry
out at once, so as to drown the voice of the minister.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. William Hales, D.D., in his “Methodism Inspected,”
accounts for these paroxysms on “natural grounds;
the sympathetic nature of all violent emotions being well
known to those who have studied the physical and moral constitution
of man.”</p>

<p>Southey writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A powerful doctrine, preached with passionate sincerity, produced a
powerful effect upon weak minds, ardent feelings, and disordered fancies.
There are passions which are as infectious as the plague, and fear itself
is not more so than fanaticism. When once these bodily affections were
declared to be the throes of the new birth, a free licence was proclaimed
for every kind of extravagance; and when the preacher encouraged them
to throw off all restraint, and abandon themselves before the congregation
to these mixed sensations of mind and body, the consequences were what
might be anticipated.”</p>
</div>

<p>Southey forgets that “powerful doctrine” was preached,
with as much “passionate sincerity,” by Whitefield and by
Charles Wesley, as by Wesley himself; but without the same
effects. Besides, it is untrue that Wesley ever “encouraged”
the affected people “to abandon themselves to these mixed
sensations of mind and body.”</p>

<p>The Rev. R. Watson writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That cases of real enthusiasm occurred at this and subsequent
periods, is indeed allowed. There are always nervous, dreamy, and excitable
people to be found; and the emotion produced among these
would often be communicated by natural sympathy. No one could be
blamed for this, unless he had encouraged the excitement for its own
sake, or taught the people to regard it as a sign of grace, which most
assuredly Mr. Wesley never did. Nor is it correct to represent these
effects, genuine and fictitious together, as peculiar to Methodism. Great
and rapid results were produced in the first ages of Christianity, but not
without ‘outcries,’ and strong corporeal as well as mental emotions. Like
effects often accompanied the preaching of eminent men at the Reformation;
and many of the Puritan and Nonconformist ministers had similar
successes in our own country. In Scotland, and also among the grave
Presbyterians of New England, previous to the rise of Methodism, the
ministry of faithful men had been attended by very similar circumstances;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
and, on a smaller scale, the same results have followed the ministry of
modern missionaries of different religious societies in various parts of the
world. It may be laid down as a principle established by fact, that
whenever a zealous and faithful ministry is raised up, after a long, spiritual
dearth, the early effects of that ministry are not only powerful, but often
attended with extraordinary circumstances; nor are such extraordinary
circumstances necessarily extravagancies because they are not common.
It is neither irrational nor unscriptural to suppose, that times of great
national darkness and depravity should require a strong remedy; and
that the attention of the people should be roused by circumstances which
could not fail to be noticed by the most unthinking. We do not attach
primary importance to secondary circumstances; but they are not to be
wholly disregarded. The Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake,
nor in the fire, but in the still small voice; yet that still small
voice might not have been heard, except by minds roused from their inattention
by the shaking of the earth and the sounding of the storm.”</p>
</div>

<p>Isaac Taylor writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These disorders resembled, in some of their features, the demoniacal
possessions mentioned in the gospel history. The bodily agitations were
perhaps as extreme in the one class of instances as in the other; nevertheless,
there is no real analogy between the two. The demoniacs were
<i>found</i> in this state by Christ where He went preaching; they did not
<i>become such</i> while listening to Him. Besides, in no one instance recorded
in the Gospels or Acts, did demoniacal possession, or any bodily agitations
resembling it, come on as the initial stage of conversion. How
then are we to dispose of such cases? Perhaps not at all to our satisfaction,
except so far as this, that they serve to render so much the more
unambiguous the distinction between themselves and those genuine affections
which the apostolic writers describe and exemplify.”</p>
</div>

<p>What says Wesley himself? With due deference to the
great names quoted, we respect his testimony more than
theirs: first, because he was, in sobriety of feeling, in depth of
learning, and in clearness of judgment, at least their equal;
and secondly, because his opinion was pronounced after being
an eye-witness, whilst theirs is founded entirely upon the
representations of others, and their own ideas of how things
ought to be.</p>

<p>1. The cases were real, not pretended, and often ended in
genuine conversion. “You deny,” writes Wesley at the time,
“You deny that God does now work these effects; at least, that
He works them in this manner. I affirm both; because I have
heard these things with my own ears, and have seen them
with my own eyes. I have seen very many persons changed, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
a moment, from the spirit of fear, horror, despair, to the spirit
of love, joy, and peace; and from sinful desire, till then reigning
over them, to the pure desire of doing the will of God. I
know several persons, in whom this great change was wrought
in a dream, or during a strong representation to the eye of
their mind, of Christ either on the cross, or in glory. This is
the fact; let any judge of it as they please.”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>2. Why were these things permitted? Wesley says: “Perhaps
it might be because of the hardness of our hearts, unready
to receive anything unless we see it with our eyes and hear it
with our ears, that God, in tender condescension to our weakness,
suffered so many outward signs of the very time when
He wrought this inward change to be continually seen and
heard among us. But although they saw ‘signs and wonders’
(for so I must term them), yet many would not believe.
They could not indeed deny the facts; but they could explain
them away.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>3. How were these extraordinary circumstances brought
about? Wesley again shall answer. Five years after—when
he had heard all that his enemies had to say—when such convulsive
agitations no longer happened—and when he had had
sufficient time to test the genuineness of these remarkable
Bristol and Kingswood conversions, and to form a calm
judgment upon the whole, he wrote as follows:—“The
<i>extraordinary</i> circumstances that attended the conviction or
repentance of the people may be easily accounted for, either
on principles of reason or Scripture. First, on principles of
reason. For how easy is it to suppose, that a strong, lively,
and sudden apprehension of the heinousness of sin, the wrath
of God and the bitter pains of eternal death, should affect
the body as well as the soul, during the present laws of vital
union;—should interrupt or disturb the ordinary circulations,
and put nature out of its course? Yea, we may question,
whether, while this union subsists, it be possible for the mind
to be affected, in so violent a degree, without some or other
of those bodily symptoms following. Secondly, it is likewise
easy to account for these things on principles of Scripture.
For when we take a view of them in this light, we are to add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
to the consideration of natural causes the agency of those
spirits who still excel in strength, and, as far as they have
leave from God, will not fail to torment whom they cannot
destroy; <i>to tear</i> those that <i>are coming</i> to Christ. It is also
remarkable that there is plain Scripture precedent of every
symptom which has lately appeared.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>We have nothing more to add. Perhaps the reader will
think that more has been said than the thing deserved. We
demur to that opinion. The phenomena recorded are among
the most remarkable in church history; they are curious and
mysterious; they have given rise to endless critiques, both
friendly and otherwise, and, for such reasons, merit the space
we have devoted to them. Dr. Hales’ doctrine of “the sympathetic
nature of all violent emotions,” though true, is not
sufficient to account for many of the instances related.
Southey’s opinion is flippant, and is based upon false assumptions.
Watson’s is of great importance, and, as contained at
greater length in his Life of Wesley, is the most elaborate
discussion of the subject that has yet been written. Isaac
Taylor’s, to some extent, coincides with Wesley’s; which,
upon the whole, is the clearest, fullest, and the best.</p>

<p>Other events, belonging to the year 1739, must now be
noticed.</p>

<p>Kingswood, so often mentioned, was formerly a royal
chase, containing between three and four thousand acres; but,
previous to the rise of Methodism, it had been gradually
appropriated by the several lords whose estates encircled it.
The deer had disappeared, and the greater part of the wood
also; coal mines had been discovered, and it was now inhabited
by a race of people, as lawless as the foresters, their
forefathers, but far more brutal; and differing as much from
the people of the surrounding country in dialect as in appearance.
They had no place of worship; for Kingswood then
belonged to the parish of St. Philip, and was, at least, three
miles distant from the parish church.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The people were
famous for neither fearing God nor regarding man; and so
ignorant of sacred things that they seemed but one remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
from the beasts that perish. They were utterly without
desire of instruction, as well as without the means of it. The
place resounded with cursing and blasphemy. It was filled
with clamour and bitterness, wrath and envyings, idle
diversions, drunkenness, and uncleanness;<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> a hell upon earth.
Only fifteen weeks before Whitefield’s first visit, the colliers
had risen with clubs and firearms, and gone from pit to pit
threatening the lives of all the workmen who would not join
them in defeating the ends of justice, in reference to a riot
that had occurred a short time previously. At White Hill,
four mines were filled up; and carts, reels, and ropes belonging
to others were cut and burned. The soldiers were called
out, and the swarthy rioters ran away.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Kingswood was Whitefield’s first field-pulpit, for here, on
February 17, 1739, he began his glorious career of out-door
preaching. Within six weeks after this, the day before
Wesley came to Bristol, Whitefield dined with the colliers,
who contributed upwards of £20 towards the erection of a
school. Four days after this, the miners prepared him
another hospitable entertainment, after which he laid the
foundation stone, knelt upon it, and offered prayer, to which
the colliers said, “Amen.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, Whitefield took his departure from
Bristol, leaving Wesley as his successor; and, with the exception
of a visit of a week’s duration in the month of July
following, he was not at Kingswood again during the next
two years. Whitefield began the school at Kingswood: the
colliers gave upwards of £20; Whitefield collected £40 in
subscriptions; and, on two subsequent occasions, he made
collections for the same purpose, once when he preached his
farewell sermon at Bristol, on July 13, before embarking for
America; and once in Moorfields, when the sum of £24 9<i>s.</i>
was contributed.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> This was all. The rest devolved on
Wesley. He alone was responsible for the payment of the
debts incurred; and, for many months, wherever he went, he
begged subscriptions for the colliers’ school. The school
itself consisted of one large room, with four smaller ones for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the teacher’s residence, and was not completed till the spring
of 1740.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The object was to teach the children of the poor,
first religion, and then to read, write, and cast accounts; but
Wesley also expected to have “scholars of all ages, some of
them grey-headed,” who were to be taught, separate from the
children, “either early in the morning, or late at night,” so
that their work might not be hindered by their education.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Within six weeks after Whitefield laid the first stone of
Kingswood school, Wesley took possession of a piece of
ground in the Horse Fair, Bristol, and began to build a room
large enough to contain the societies of Nicholas Street and
Baldwin Street. This was done without the least apprehension
or design of his being personally engaged, either in
the expense of the work, or in the direction of it; he having
appointed eleven trustees, by whom he supposed the burdens
would be borne. He soon found that he had made a
great mistake. In a short time, a debt was contracted of
more than £150, whereas the subscriptions of the trustees
and of the two societies were not a quarter of that
amount. This debt devolved upon him. He had no money,
nor any human prospect or probability of procuring any;
but he knew “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof,” and he dared to trust Him. Besides this, Whitefield
and other friends in London most strongly objected to
the building being the property of trustees, on the ground
that Wesley would be under their control; and, unless
his preaching pleased them, they might eject him from
the house he himself had built. Whitefield declared that,
unless the trustship was destroyed, neither he nor his friends
would contribute anything towards the expenses. Wesley
yielded; the trustees were summoned; all agreed to the
alteration; the deed was cancelled; and Wesley became the
sole proprietor.</p>

<p>This, though insignificant at the time, was a matter of great
importance; for, in this manner, nearly all the chapels, erected
in the early part of his career, were vested in himself,—a thing
involving serious responsibility, which, however, was honourably
fulfilled; for trusts were afterwards created; and, by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
“Deed of Declaration,” all his interests in his chapels were
transferred to his Legal Conference.</p>

<p>Thus we find Wesley, with no income whatever, except the
small amount arising out of his Oxford fellowship, involved
in what, to a poor man, were two serious undertakings. But
even this was not all the burden that he took upon himself.
He spent the beginning of November in London; and whilst
there, two gentlemen, then unknown to him, came again and
again, urging him to preach in a place called the Foundery,
near Moorfields. With much reluctance he consented. He
writes:—“Sunday, November 11, I preached at eight to five
or six thousand, on the spirit of bondage and the spirit of
adoption; and, at five in the evening, to seven or eight
thousand, in the place which had been the king’s foundery for
cannon.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> He was then pressed to take the place into his own
hands. He did so. The purchase-money was £115; but the
place being “a vast, uncouth heap of ruins,” a large sum
additional to this had to be expended in needful repairs, in
building two galleries for men and women hearers respectively,
and in enlarging a room for the society to almost
thrice its present size. To meet this large expenditure,
Ball, Watkins, and other friends lent him the purchase-money;
and offered to pay subscriptions, some four, some six,
and some ten shillings a year towards the liquidation of the
debt. In three years, these subscriptions amounted to about
£480, leaving however a balance of nearly £300, for which
Wesley was still responsible.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> From this it would seem that
the entire cost of the old Foundery was about £800.</p>

<p>This was the first Methodist meeting-house of which the
metropolis could boast, and a brief description of it may not
be out of place.</p>

<p>It stood in the locality called “Windmill Hill,” now known
by the name of Windmill Street, a street that runs parallel
with City Road, and abuts on the north-west corner of Finsbury
Square. The building was placed on the east side of
the street, some sixteen or eighteen yards from Providence
Row; and measured about forty yards in front, from north to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
south, and about thirty-three yards in depth, from east to
west. There were two front doors, one leading to the chapel,
and the other to the preacher’s house, school, and bandroom.
A bell was hung in a plain belfry, and was rung every morning
at five o’clock for early service, and every evening at nine for
family worship; as well as at sundry other times. The chapel,
which would accommodate some fifteen hundred people,
was without pews; but, on the ground floor, immediately
before the pulpit, were about a dozen seats with back rails,
appropriated to female worshippers. Under the front gallery
were the free seats for women; and, under the side galleries,
the free seats for men. The front gallery was used exclusively
by females, and the side galleries by males. “From the beginning,”
says Wesley, “the men and women sat apart, as they
always did in the primitive church; and none were suffered
to call any place their own, but the first comers sat down
first. They had no pews; and all the benches for rich and
poor were of the same construction.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>The bandroom was behind the chapel, on the ground floor,
some eighty feet long and twenty feet wide, and accommodated
about three hundred persons. Here the classes met; here, in
winter, the five o’clock morning service was conducted; and
here were held, at two o’clock, on Wednesdays and Fridays,
weekly meetings for prayer and intercession. The north end
of the room was used for a school, and was fitted up with desks;
and at the south end was “The Book Room” for the sale of
Wesley’s publications.</p>

<p>Over the bandroom were apartments for Wesley, in which
his mother died;<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and, at the end of the chapel was a
dwelling house for his domestics and assistant preachers;
while attached to the whole was a small building used as a
coach-house and stable.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Why was the building called the Foundery? Because, for
a number of years, it was used by the government in casting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
cannon. When Wesley bought it, the edifice had been a ruin
for about twenty years. In 1716, whilst recasting the injured
guns taken from the French in the successful campaigns of
Marlborough, a terrible explosion blew off the roof, shook the
building, killed several of the workmen, burnt others, and
broke the limbs of not a few. This led to an abandonment
of the place, and the removal of the royal foundery to Woolwich.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
The next occupants were Wesley and the Methodists;
and the echoes of prayer and praise succeeded the clang of
anvils and the roar of furnaces of fire.</p>

<p>When first opened, it was described by Silas Told as “a
ruinous place, with an old pantile covering,” the structure to a
great extent consisting of “decayed timbers,” and the pulpit
being made of “a few rough boards.”<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> It may be interesting,
to the curious reader, to add, that a few years ago, the old
Foundery bell, used in calling the people to the five o’clock
preaching, was still in existence, and was attached to the
school at Friar’s Mount, London; that, at the present moment,
the old Foundery pulpit is preserved at Richmond,
and is used by the Richmond students every week; and that
the old Foundery chandelier is now in use in the chapel at
Bowes, in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>This was really the cradle of London Methodism. Here
Wesley began to preach at the end of 1739. The character
of the services held in this rotten, pantile covered building
may be learnt from Wesley’s Works. Wesley began the
service with a short prayer, then sung a hymn and preached
(usually about half an hour), then sung a few verses of another
hymn, and concluded with a prayer. His constant theme
was, salvation by faith, preceded by repentance, and followed
by holiness.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The place was rough and the people poor; but
the service simple, scriptural, beautiful. No wonder, that
such a priest, shut out of the elaborately wrought pulpits of
the Established Church, and now cooped up within a pulpit
made of “<i>rough</i> deal boards,” should be powerful, popular,
and triumphant.</p>

<p>Passing from pulpits to preachers, we must venture here to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
correct an error, which, from the first, seems to have been
current in the Methodist community. All Methodist historians
have assumed that Thomas Maxfield was Methodism’s
first lay preacher; that is, the first who was allowed to expound
the Scriptures without being formally ordained to that
holy service. This is a mistake. Thomas Maxfield was not
converted until the 21st of May, 1739; and yet, a month after
this, we find John Cennick, the converted land surveyor,
employed with Wesley’s sanction, in preaching to the Kingswood
colliers.</p>

<p>Methodism’s first lay preacher deserves a passing notice.
He has never yet had justice done him, and we regret that
limited space prevents justice being rendered even here.</p>

<p>John Cennick was the son of Quakers, and, from infancy,
was taught to pray every night and morning. At thirteen
years of age, he went nine times, from Reading to London,
to be apprenticed to a trade, but all to no purpose, except
that he was taken on trial by a carpenter, who refused to
retain his services when the time was come for his being
bound. In 1735, John was convinced of sin, while walking
in Cheapside, and, at once, left off song singing, card playing,
and attending theatres. Sometimes he wished to go into a
popish monastery, to spend his life in devout retirement. At
other times, he longed to live in a cave, sleeping on fallen
leaves, and feeding on forest fruits. He fasted long and often,
and prayed nine times every day. He was afraid of seeing
ghosts, and terribly apprehensive lest he should meet the
devil. Fancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so
great a sinner as himself, he began to feed on potatoes, acorns,
crabs, and grass; and often wished he could live upon roots
and herbs. At length, on September 6, 1737, he found peace
with God, and went on his way rejoicing. Like Howel
Harris, he, at once, commenced preaching; and also began to
write hymns, a number of which Charles Wesley, in July,
1739, corrected for the press.</p>

<p>We have already seen that, in March, 1739, Wesley and
Cennick met at Reading. Shortly after that, Whitefield proposed
that Cennick should become the master of the school
in Kingswood, whose first stone was laid in the month of
May; and, on the 11th of June, off he set on foot, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Reading to Bristol, sleeping all night in an old stable on his
way. On arriving there, he found that Wesley had gone to
London; but was invited to go to Kingswood to hear a young
man (query, Thomas Maxfield?) read a sermon to the colliers.
The place for meeting was under a sycamore tree, near the
intended school. Four or five hundred colliers were assembled,
but the young reader had not arrived. Cennick was
requested to take his place; he reluctantly complied, preached
a sermon, and says, “The Lord bore witness with my words,
insomuch that many believed in that hour.” Cennick preached
again on the day following, and on the succeeding sabbath
twice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Howel Harris came; and, on the ensuing Tuesday,
Wesley. How did Wesley receive the two lay preachers?
Harris went to Wesley’s lodgings. They fell upon their knees;
and Harris writes, “He was greatly enlarged in prayer for me,
and for all Wales.” Full of holy feeling, the Welsh evangelist
crossed the channel, and found wider doors of usefulness
than ever. Cennick too was not restrained. He tells us,
that many of the people desired Wesley to forbid him; but,
so far from doing so, he encouraged him; and, thus encouraged,
he preached constantly in Kingswood and the neighbouring
villages for the next eighteen months, and sometimes supplied
Wesley’s place in Bristol, when he was absent, preaching in
other towns.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Honour to whom honour is due. We repudiate the wish to
take from Maxfield a particle of fame, which of right belongs
to him; but there cannot be a doubt that John Cennick was
one of Wesley’s lay preachers before Maxfield was. Neither
is there aught contradictory to this in Wesley’s writings. It
is true, that Wesley, after mentioning that the first society
was formed at the end of 1739, goes on to say: “After a time,
a young man, Thomas Maxfield, came and desired to help me
as a son in the gospel;”<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> but this is not opposed to the fact,
that John Cennick had already helped him at Kingswood,
Bristol, and other places. Myles thinks that it is probable,
that Maxfield, Richards, and Westall were all employed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Wesley in the beginning of the year 1740.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Perhaps so; but
we have already seen that Cennick was preaching, with the
approbation and encouragement of Wesley, as early as the
month of June, 1739.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>This is not the place to pursue the footsteps of Methodism’s
first lay preacher. Suffice it to remark, though his career was
comparatively short, in zealous and successful labour it is
difficult to equal it. Cennick had his weaknesses; but, in
deadness to the world, communion with God, Christian
courage, and cheerful patience, he had few superiors. Despite
his Calvinism and his differences with Wesley, we admire
and love the man. He died in 1755.</p>

<p>Here then was another momentous step taken by the
arch-Methodist. Wesley had been bred within a strict ecclesiastical
enclosure. He was firm in his attachment to the
principles and practices of the English Church, and was far
from being indifferent to the prerogatives of its priests; but
he was far too wise and reverent a man to say that the salvation
of the human family would be too dearly purchased if
promoted by a departure from church usages. Christianity,
though conserved by church order, does not exist for the sake
of it. As a student of church history, Wesley must have
known that, again and again, unless order had given way to
a higher necessity, the gospel, instead of holding on its way
in its brightness and in its purity, would, long ere now, in the
hands of idolizers of ancient rules, have been extinguished in
the very path where it ought to have shed an unceasing flame.
In no man was there a greater combination of docility and
courage; and hence, when Wesley met with men like Cennick,
full of fervent consciousness of the reality, power, and blessedness
of Christ’s religion; and employing a style, terse from
intensity of feeling, and copious from the fulness of their
theme,—no wonder that, instead of forbidding, he encouraged
them to preach the glorious truths, which they not merely
understood, but felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>This was a startling innovation; and, doubtless, horrified
the stereotyped ministries and priesthoods existing round
about; but the fields were white to the harvest, and the
labourers were few; and Wesley could not, durst not, forbid
an increase to the staff, because the added workers had not
been trained in colleges, and came not in all the priestly
paraphernalia of surplices and hoods, gowns and bands. No
doubt he would have preferred the employment of clerics like
himself; but, in the absence of such, he was driven to adopt
the measure which we think the salvation of his system, and,
in some respects, its glory.</p>

<p>“I knew your brother well,” said Robinson, the Archbishop
of Armagh, when he met Charles Wesley at the Hotwells,
Bristol: “I knew your brother well; I could never credit
all I heard respecting him and you; but one thing in your
conduct I could never account for, your employing laymen.”
“My Lord,” said Charles, “the fault is yours and your
brethren’s.” “How so?” asked the primate. “Because you
hold your peace, and the stones cry out.” “But I am told,”
his grace continued, “that they are unlearned men.” “Some
are,” said the sprightly poet, “and so the dumb ass rebukes
the prophet.” His lordship said no more.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>The following letter of Whitefield has not been previously
printed so fully as at present. As it was written at the time
when Cennick began preaching, it may appropriately be inserted
here. Its references to other matters are also deeply
interesting.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>June 25, 1739</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,—I suspend my judgment of Brother Watkins’ and
Cennick’s behaviour till I am better acquainted with the circumstances of
their proceeding. I think there is a great difference between them and
Howel Harris. He has offered himself thrice for holy orders; him therefore
and our friends at Cambridge I shall encourage: others I cannot
countenance in acting in so public a manner. The consequences of
beginning to teach too soon will be exceeding bad—Brother Ingham is of
my opinion.</p>

<p>“I hear, honoured sir, you are about to print a sermon on predestination.
It shocks me to think of it; what will be the consequences but
controversy? If people ask me my opinion, what shall I do? I have a
critical part to act, God enable me to behave aright! Silence on both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
sides will be best. It is noised abroad already, that there is a division
between you and me. Oh, my heart within me is grieved!</p>

<p>“Providence to-morrow calls me to Gloucester. If you will be pleased
to come next week to London, I think, God willing, to stay a few days at
Bristol. Your brother Charles goes to Oxon. I believe we shall be
excommunicated soon. May the Lord enable us to stand fast in the faith;
and stir up your heart to watch over the soul of, honoured sir,</p>

<p class="psig">
“Your dutiful son and servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.</p>
<p>
“To the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Mrs. Grevil’s,<br />
a Grocer in Wine Street, Bristol.”</p>
</div>

<p>We must proceed to another matter. Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the latter end of the year 1739, eight or ten persons came to me in
London, who appeared to be deeply convinced of sin, and earnestly
groaning for redemption. They desired, I would spend some time with
them in prayer, and advise them how to flee from the wrath to come.
That we might have more time for this great work, I appointed a day
when they might all come together, which, from thenceforward, they did
every Thursday, in the evening. To these, and as many more as desired
to join with them, (for the number increased daily,) I gave those advices,
from time to time, which I judged most needful for them; and we always
concluded our meeting with prayer suited to their several necessities.
This was the rise of the United Society, first in London, and then in other
places.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In another place, he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first evening about twelve persons came; the next week, thirty or
forty. When they were increased to about a hundred, I took down their
names and places of abode, intending, as often as it was convenient,
to call upon them at their houses. Thus, without any previous plan,
began the Methodist Society in England,—a company of people associating
together to help each other to work out their own salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>
</div>

<p>No doubt the whole of this is strictly true; but there are
other facts to be remembered.</p>

<p>By the preaching of the two Wesleys and of Whitefield, a
large number of persons in London had been converted; and
most of these had been incorporated in the Moravian bands.
When Wesley went to Bristol, at the end of March, the
work in London devolved, to a great extent, on his brother
Charles. Disputes soon sprung up. On Easter day, Charles
had a conversation with Zinzendorf “about motions, visions,
and dreams, and was confirmed in his dislike to them.” On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
April 28, Whitefield preached in Islington churchyard;
and, after he had done, Bowers, a Moravian, got up to speak.
Charles Wesley says: “I conjured him not; but he beat me
down, and followed <i>his impulse</i>.” On the 16th of May, a
dispute arose, in the Moravian meeting at Fetter Lane, about
lay preaching. Many were zealous for it; but Whitefield and
Charles Wesley declared against it. In June, another Moravian,
John Shaw, “the self-ordained priest,” as Charles
Wesley calls him, “was brimful of proud wrath and fierceness”;
and two others, Bowers and Bray, whom Whitefield
designated “two grand enthusiasts,” followed Charles to
Blendon, “drunk with the spirit of delusion.” In the Moravian
society, Shaw “pleaded for his spirit of prophecy”; and
charged Charles Wesley “with love of pre-eminence, and with
making his proselytes twofold more the children of the devil
than they were before.” Many misunderstandings and offences
had crept in; and Wesley came from Bristol to put things
right. A humiliation meeting was held at Fetter Lane; and
“we acknowledged,” says Wesley, “our having grieved God
by our divisions; ‘one saying, I am of Paul; another, I am of
Apollos’; by our leaning again to our own works, and trusting
in them, instead of Christ; by our resting in those little
beginnings of sanctification, which it had pleased Him to work
in our souls; and, above all, by blaspheming His work among
us, imputing it either to nature, to the force of imagination
and animal spirits, or even to the delusion of the devil.”
Things seem to have proceeded more smoothly till about
September, when, in the absence of the two Wesleys, “certain
men crept in among them unawares, telling them, that they
had deceived themselves, and had no true faith at all. ‘For,’
said they, ‘none has any justifying faith, who has ever any
doubt or fear, which you know you have; or who has not a
clean heart, which you know you have not; nor will you ever
have it, till you leave off running to church and sacrament, and
praying, and singing, and reading either the Bible, or any other
book; for you cannot use these things without trusting in them.
Therefore, till you leave them off, you can never have true faith;
you can never till then trust in the blood of Christ.’”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>This was a serious heresy; and, on November 1, Wesley
hurried up to London to put a check to it. He acknowledges,
that the Moravians still held the grand doctrine of justification
by faith; and that the fruits of faith were “righteousness,
peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.” He testifies, that
they were free from the sins of swearing, theft, gluttony,
drunkenness, and adultery; that they had no diversions but
such as become saints; that they regarded not outward
adorning, and were not slothful in business. He confesses,
that they fed the hungry, and clothed the naked; that their
discipline was scarce inferior to that of the apostolic age;
and, that every one knew and kept his proper place; but,
despite all this, he found them far from perfect.</p>

<p>On first entering the society, he found Mr. Bray “highly
commending the being still before God; and speaking largely
of the danger that attended the doing of outward works,
and of the folly of people running about to church and
sacrament.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 4, the “society met at seven in the
morning, and continued silent till eight.” In the evening, at
Fetter Lane, “some of the brethren asserted in plain terms:
1. That, till they had true faith, they ought to be still; that
is, to abstain from the means of grace, the Lord’s supper in
particular. 2. That the ordinances are not means of grace,
there being no other means than Christ.”</p>

<p>Three days later, Wesley had a long conference with Spangenberg,
who substantially avowed the same opinions. At
night, the Fetter Lane society sat an hour without speaking;
and then there followed a warm dispute, to prove that
none ought to receive the Lord’s supper till he had “the full
assurance of faith.” Every day Wesley met with many “who
once knew in whom they had believed, but were now thrown
into idle reasonings, and were filled with doubts and fears.
Many had left off the means of grace, saying they must now
cease from their own works, and must trust in Christ alone;
that they were poor sinners, and had nothing to do but to lie
at His feet.”</p>

<p>Wesley did his utmost to correct this state of things, and
then, on November 21, went back to Bristol. On his way,
he came to Wycombe, where he unexpectedly met Mr. Gam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>bold
and a Mr. Robson. He writes: “After much consultation
and prayer, we agreed—1. To meet yearly at London
on the eve of Ascension day. 2. To fix then the business to
be done the ensuing year; where, when, and by whom. 3. To
meet quarterly there, as many as can; viz., on the second
Tuesday in July, October, and January. 4. To send a
monthly account to one another, of what God hath done in
each of our stations. 5. To inquire whether Messrs. Hall,
Sympson, Rogers, Ingham, Hutchins, Kinchin, Stonehouse,
Cennick, Oxlee, and Brown will join with us herein. 6. To
consider whether there be any others of our spiritual friends,
who are able and willing so to do.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> This arrangement is
important as indicative of Wesley’s purpose at this early
period of his history; but it was never put into execution.
The rupture with the Moravians made it a dead letter.</p>

<p>Five weeks afterwards, he returned to London with a heavy
heart. “Scarce one in ten of the Moravians retained his first
love; and most of the rest were in the utmost confusion,
biting and devouring one another.” His soul was sick of
their “sublime divinity.” He had a long conversation with
Molther, one of their ministers, and ascertained that the difference
between them was the following:—</p>

<p>1. The Moravians held that there are no degrees of faith;
and that no man has any degree of it, before he has the full
assurance of faith, the abiding witness of the Spirit, or the
clear perception that Christ dwelleth in him. Wesley dissented
from this.</p>

<p>2. The Moravians taught that the way to attain faith is to
wait for Christ, and be still: that is, not to use the means of
grace; not to go to church; not to communicate; not to
fast; not to use private prayer; not to read the Scriptures;
not to do temporal good; nor to attempt doing spiritual
good; because it was impossible for a man to use means like
these without trusting in them. Wesley believed just the
opposite.</p>

<p>3. The Moravians thought that in propagating faith, guile
might be used: (1) By saying what we know will deceive the
hearers, or lead them to think the thing which is not; (2) by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
describing things a little beyond the truth, in order to their
coming up to it; (3) by speaking as if we meant what we did
not mean. Wesley denounced all this.</p>

<p>4. The Moravians believed that the fruits of their thus
propagating the faith in England were: (1) Much good had
been done by it; (2) many were unsettled from a false foundation;
(3) many were brought into true stillness; (4) some
were grounded on the true foundation, who were wrong before.
Wesley, on the contrary, thought that very little good, but
much hurt, had been done, by such proceedings.</p>

<p>This was the state of things when Wesley “began the first
Methodist society in England.” He was dissatisfied with his
old Moravian friends, and well he might. He had been prominent
in the formation of their society at Fetter Lane, on
the 1st of May, 1738; but his hopes and aspirations concerning
it were blighted; and hence he formed another society
of his own. Moravian heresies had, in London at least,
corrupted the Moravian bands; numbers were offended;
these and others repaired to Wesley; Wesley took down
their names, and met them every Thursday evening for
spiritual advice and prayer; success followed; and the
Methodist society was instituted. We must return to this
subject in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Wesley spent most of the year 1739 in Bristol and the
immediate neighbourhood; but, at different times, he rendered
important service in other places. At Blackheath, he preached
to twelve or fourteen thousand people; and on Kennington
Common to twenty thousand. In Moorfields, he had a congregation
of ten thousand. In Gloucester he preached to
seven thousand;<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and in Bath, Bradford, and elsewhere, to
great multitudes. He also preached, at least once, in the
mansion of Lady Huntingdon, taking a bold text for such a
fashionable audience: “The cares of the world, and the deceitfulness
of riches, and the desires of other things, choke the
word, and it becometh unfruitful.”</p>

<p>He also met with some adventures and incidents worth
mentioning. In riding to Rose Green, his horse suddenly fell,
and rolled over and over. A gentleman, at Bradford, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
had wished him good luck in the name of the Lord, told
him that his fellow collegians at Oxford always considered
him “a little crack-brained.” In one instance, the pressgang
came when he was in the middle of his sermon, and seized
one of his hearers. While preaching in Turner’s Hall, London,
the floor gave way, but fortunately the vault below was filled
with hogsheads of tobacco, so that the crowded congregation
only sunk a foot or two, and he proceeded without further interruption.
At Oxford, he was grieved to find that none now
visited the workhouse and the prison, and that the Methodist
little school was about to be given up. At Stanley, on a
little green, he preached for two hours amid the darkness
of an October night. At Newport, he addressed “the
most insensible, ill behaved people” he had seen in
Wales; one old man cursing and swearing incessantly, and
taking up a great stone to throw at him. The people of
Wales generally he found as ignorant of gospel truth as the
Cherokee Indians; and asks, “What spirit is he of, who had
rather these poor creatures should perish for lack of knowledge
than that they should be saved, even by the exhortations of
Howel Harris, or an itinerant preacher?” Words these well
worth pondering; for they are added proof, that Wesley, even
as early as 1739, was not opposed to the employment of lay
evangelists.</p>

<p>The principle upon which Wesley acted was to shrink from
nothing that he judged to be conducive to his being made a
Christian.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> On this ground he went to Georgia, and to Germany;
and says, “I am ready to go to Abyssinia or China,
or whithersoever it shall please God to call me.” He was
accused of being an enemy of the Church of England; but
maintained that he was not. The doctrines he preached
were the doctrines of the Church, as laid down in her prayers,
articles, and homilies. He allows that there were five points
of difference between him and many of the clergy; but he
contends that <i>they</i>, not <i>he</i>, were unfaithful to the Church.
The points were these:—1. Those from whom he differed
spoke of justification, either as the same thing with sanctification,
or as something consequent upon it. He believed it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
be wholly distinct from sanctification, and necessarily antecedent
to it. 2. They spoke of good works as the cause of
justification. He believed the death and righteousness of
Christ to be the whole and sole cause of it. 3. They spoke
of good works as existing previous to justification. He believed
that no good work is possible, previous to justification,
and therefore no good work can be a condition of it; till we
are justified we are ungodly, and incapable of good works;
we are justified by faith alone, faith without works, faith producing
all good works, yet including none. 4. They spoke
of sanctification as if it were an outward thing. He believed
it to be an inward thing,—the life of God in the soul of man;
a participation of the Divine nature; the mind that was in
Christ. 5. They spoke of the new birth as synonymous with
baptism; or, at most, a change from a vicious to a virtuous
life. He believed it to be an entire change of nature, from
the image of the devil, wherein we are born, to the image of
God; a change from earthly and sensual to heavenly and
holy affections. “There is, therefore,” says he, “a wide,
essential, fundamental, irreconcilable difference between us.
If they speak the truth as it is in Jesus, I am found a false
witness before God. But if I teach the way of God in truth,
they are blind leaders of the blind.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> He contends that he
“simply described the plain, old religion of the Church of
England, which was now almost everywhere spoken against,
under the new name of Methodism.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Wesley was a great reader; and some of the most interesting
entries in his Journals are his critiques on books; but, in
1739, he seems to have been too busy preaching to have had
time for reading. The only notice of this kind is the following:
“1739, October 23. In riding to Bradford, I read over
Mr. Law’s book on the new birth. Philosophical, speculative,
precarious; Behmenish, void, and vain! ‘O what a fall is
there!’” This is a harsh reflection upon an old friend; but,
about a year and a half before, there had been the unfortunate
quarrel with William Law, already mentioned. See pp. <a href="#Page_185">185</a>‒8.</p>

<p>Up to the present, Wesley’s mother had been his chief
counsellor. Immediately after his conversion in May, 1738,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
he went to Germany, and returned to England in September.
It so happened, that he and his mother had no interview until
nine months after this. Before he went to Herrnhuth, he had
related to her the particulars of his conversion, for which “she
heartily blessed God, who had brought him to so just a way
of thinking.” Meanwhile, however, she had been prejudiced
against him, and had entertained “strange fears concerning
him, being convinced that he had greatly erred from the
faith.” This was not of long continuance. Hence the following
entry in Wesley’s journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1739, September 3.—I talked largely with my mother, who told me
that, till a short time since, she had scarce heard such a thing mentioned
as the having God’s Spirit bearing witness with our spirit: much less did
she imagine that this was the common privilege of all true believers.
‘Therefore,’ said she, ‘I never durst ask for it myself. But two or three
weeks ago, while my son Hall was pronouncing these words, in delivering
the cup to me, “The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for
thee,” the words struck through my heart, and I knew God, for Christ’s
sake, had forgiven me all my sins.‘
“I asked whether her father (Dr. Annesley) had not the same faith;
and whether she had not heard him preach it to others. She answered,
he had it himself; and declared, a little before his death, that, for more
than forty years, he had no darkness, no fear, no doubt at all of his being
accepted in the Beloved. But that, nevertheless, she did not remember
to have heard him preach, no, not once, explicitly upon it: whence she
supposed he also looked upon it as the peculiar blessing of a few; not as
promised to all the people of God.”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Ever after this, Susannah Wesley resided chiefly in London,
and attended the ministry of her sons John and Charles. She
heartily embraced their doctrines, and conversed with the
members of their society. Hence the following from one of
her letters to Charles, dated December 27, 1739:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your brother, whom I shall henceforth call <i>Son Wesley</i>, since my
dear Sam is gone home, has just been with me, and much revived my
spirits. Indeed, I have often found that he never speaks in my hearing
without my receiving some spiritual benefit. But his visits are seldom
and short; for which I never blame him, because I know he is well
employed, and, blessed be God, hath great success in his ministry. But,
my dear Charles, still I want either him or you; for, indeed, in the most
literal sense, I am become a little child, and need continual succour. For
these several days, I have had the conversation of many good Christians,
who have refreshed, in some measure, my fainting spirits. I hope we
shall shortly speak face to face. But then, alas! when you come, your
brother leaves me! Yet that is the will of God, in whose blessed service
you are engaged; who has hitherto blessed your labours, and preserved
your persons. That He may continue so to prosper your work, and
protect you both from evil, and give you strength and courage to preach
the true gospel, in opposition to the united powers of evil men and evil
angels, is the hearty prayer of, dear Charles,</p>

<p>Reference is made in the above extract to the death of
Samuel Wesley, which occurred on November 6, 1739, at the
early age of forty-nine. Up to the very last, he was strongly
opposed to the Methodist movement of his brothers. In a
letter to his mother, written only seventeen days before his
death, he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My brothers are now become so notorious, that the world will be
curious to know when and where they were born, what schools bred at,
what colleges of in Oxford, and when matriculated, what degrees they
took, and where, when, and by whom ordained. I wish they may spare
so much time as to vouchsafe a little of their story. For my own part, I
had much rather have them picking straws within the walls, than preaching
in the area of Moorfields.</p>

<p>“It was with exceeding concern and grief, I heard you had countenanced
a spreading delusion, so far as to be one of Jack’s congregation.
Is it not enough that I am bereft of both my brothers, but must my mother
follow too? I earnestly beseech the Almighty to preserve you from joining
a schism at the close of your life, as you were unfortunately engaged
in one at the beginning of it. It will cost you many a protest, should you
retain your integrity, as I hope to God you will. They boast of you
already as a disciple.</p>

<p>“They design separation. They are already forbidden all the pulpits
in London; and to preach in that diocese is actual schism. In all likelihood,
it will come to the same all over England, if the bishops have
courage enough. They leave off the liturgy in the fields; and though Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
Whitefield expresses his value for it, he never once read it to his tatterdemalions
on a common. Their societies are sufficient to dissolve all
other societies but their own. Will any man of common sense, or spirit,
suffer any domestic to be in a band, engaged to relate to five or to ten
people everything, without reserve, that concerns the person’s conscience,
howmuchsoever it may concern the family? Ought any married persons
to be there, unless husband and wife be there together? This is literally
putting asunder whom God hath joined together.</p>

<p>“As I told Jack, I am not afraid the Church should excommunicate
him (discipline is at too low an ebb), but, that he should excommunicate
the Church. It is pretty near it. Holiness and good works are not so
much as <i>conditions</i> of our acceptance with God. Lovefeasts are introduced,
and extemporary prayers, and expositions of Scripture, which last
are enough to bring in all confusion; nor is it likely they will want any
miracles to support them. He only who ruleth the madness of the people
can stop them from being a formed sect. Ecclesiastical censures have
lost their terrors; thank fanaticism on the one hand, and atheism on the
other. To talk of persecution from thence is mere insult. It is—</p>

<p>Sixteen nights after writing the above, Samuel Wesley went
to bed as well as usual. At three next morning, he was seized
with illness, and, four hours afterwards, expired. John Wesley,
at the time, was in London, and Charles in Bristol; but, as
soon as possible, they hastened to Tiverton, where they rejoiced
to hear that, several days before he went hence, God
had given to their brother a calm and full assurance of his
interest in Christ.</p>

<p>In reviewing the events of the year 1739, it only remains
to notice Wesley’s publications. These were the following:—</p>

<p>1. “An Abstract of the Life and Death of Mr. Thomas
Halyburton. With recommendatory Epistle by George Whitefield,
and Preface by John Wesley.” Oswald: London. 1739.</p>

<p>Halyburton was a Scotchman, and was born in 1674.
At the age of twenty-six, he became a Presbyterian minister.
Ten years afterwards, he was appointed Professor of Divinity
in the college of St. Andrews; but almost immediately was
seized with pleurisy, and died in the thirty-seventh year
of his age.</p>

<p>Wesley’s preface is dated “London, February 9, 1739,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
and the book was published within a few weeks afterwards;
for Wesley’s brother Samuel, in a letter bearing date, April
16, 1739, says: “I have got your abridgment of Halyburton;
and, if it please God to allow me life and strength, I shall
demonstrate that the Scot as little deserves preference to
all Christians, as the book to all writings but those you
mention. There are two flagrant falsehoods in the very
first chapter. But your eyes are so fixed upon one point,
that you overlook everything else. You overshoot, but
Whitefield raves.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s abridged Life of Halyburton is a beautifully
written, and most edifying book. Why did Wesley publish
it? There can be but little doubt that his chief reasons
were:—1. Because it contains a living exemplification of real
religion. And 2. Because Halyburton’s struggles, doubts,
fears, and general experience, previous to his finding peace
with God, through faith in Christ, bear a striking resemblance
to the case of Wesley himself. After describing that the
kingdom of God, within us, is holiness and happiness, and
that the way of attaining it is a true and living faith, Wesley,
in his preface, says: “This work of God in the soul of man is
so described in the following treatise, as I have not seen
it in any other, either ancient or modern, in our own or
any other language; so that I cannot but value it, next
to the holy Scripture, above any other human composition,
except only the ‘Christian’s Pattern,’ and the small remains
of Clemens Romanus, Polycarp, and Ignatius.”</p>

<p>In the same preface, Wesley propounds thus early a
doctrine, which afterwards held a conspicuous place in the
system of truth he taught. In answering the objection, that
“the gospel covenant does not promise entire freedom from
sin,” he writes: “What do you mean by the word sin? Do
you mean those numberless weaknesses and follies, sometimes
improperly termed sins of infirmity? If so, we shall not put
off these but with our bodies. But if you mean, it does not
promise entire freedom from sin, in its proper sense, or from
committing it, this is by no means true, unless the Scripture
be false. Though it is possible a man may be a child of God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
who is not fully freed from sin, it does not follow that freedom
from sin is impossible; or that it is not to be expected by
all. It is described by the Holy Ghost as the common
privilege of all.”</p>

<p>2. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1739, was entitled:
“Nicodemus; or, a Treatise on the Fear of Man. From the
German of Augustus Herman Francke. Abridged by John
Wesley.” Bristol: S. and F. Farley. 1739.</p>

<p>The subject of the treatise was peculiarly adapted to
Wesley’s present position; and the whole is written in his
best, nervous, clear, classic style.</p>

<p>3. Wesley’s third publication was two treatises of ninety-nine
pages, 12mo; the first on Justification by Faith only; the
second on the Sinfulness of Man’s Natural Will, and his utter
inability to do works acceptable to God until he be justified
and born again of the Spirit of God: by Dr. Barnes. “With
Preface, containing some account of the author, extracted
from the Book of Martyrs. By John Wesley.”</p>

<p>This was another book congenial to Wesley’s present
feelings; inasmuch as it was full of the great doctrine, which
was now the theme of his daily ministry.</p>

<p>4. Towards the end of 1739,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Wesley published his tract,
entitled “The Character of a Methodist.” He states, that the
name of Methodists is not one which they have taken to
themselves, but one fixed upon them by way of reproach,
without their approbation or consent. The tract was written
at the urgent request of numbers of people, who were anxious
to know what were “the principles, practice, and distinguishing
marks of the sect which was everywhere spoken against.”
The distinguishing marks of a Methodist are, not his opinions,
though the Methodists are fundamentally distinguished from
Jews, Turks, and infidels; from Papists; and from Socinians
and Arians: neither are the marks of a Methodist “words
or phrases:” nor “actions, customs, or usages of an indifferent
nature:” nor the laying of the whole stress of religion on
any single part of it. “A Methodist is one who has the love
of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost given
unto him; one who loves the Lord his God with all his heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
and with all his soul, and with all his mind, and with all his
strength. He rejoices evermore, prays without ceasing, and
in everything gives thanks. His heart is full of love to all
mankind, and is purified from envy, malice, wrath, and every
unkind or malign affection. His own desire, and the one
design of his life is not to do his own will, but the will of
Him that sent him. He keeps not only some, or most of
God’s commandments, but all, from the least to the greatest.
He follows not the customs of the world; for vice does
not lose its nature through its becoming fashionable. He
fares not sumptuously every day. He cannot lay up treasures
upon earth any more than he can take fire into his bosom.
He cannot adorn himself, on any pretence, with gold or costly
apparel. He cannot join in any diversion that has the least
tendency to vice. He cannot speak evil of his neighbour,
no more than he can tell a lie. He cannot utter unkind, or
idle words. No corrupt communication ever comes out of
his mouth. He does good unto all men; unto neighbours
and strangers, friends and enemies.” “These,” says Wesley,
“are the principles and practices of our sect; these are
the marks of a true Methodist. By these alone do Methodists
desire to be distinguished from other men.”</p>

<p>Such were Methodists when Methodism was first founded
in 1739. No wonder God was with them, and honoured
them with such success. Is John Wesley’s Character of
a Methodist descriptive of all the Methodists living now?
Would to God it were!</p>

<p>5. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1739, was entitled:
“Hymns and Sacred Poems. Published by John Wesley, M.A.,
Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford; and Charles Wesley,
M.A., Student of Christ Church, Oxford.” London: 12mo,
pages 223.</p>

<p>As this book has recently been reprinted by the Methodist
Conference Office, (“Wesley Poetry,” vol. i.,) a detailed description
of its contents is not necessary. Suffice it to remark,
that, besides the productions of his brother, the volume contains
at least twenty translations from the German by Wesley
himself, and that these are among the finest hymns the
Methodists ever sing. In fact, with a few exceptions, the
hymns of the two Wesleys are the only productions in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
book worth having. Many are devout but literary rubbish,
and utterly unworthy of being used in public worship. Some
of the poems are passable; a few are beautiful; but others
might have been left, without any loss to the Christian public,
in the limbo of oblivion. Had the publication consisted only
of John and Charles Wesley’s hymns, it would have been one
of the choicest productions ever printed; as in other things,
so in this, an admixture made it weak.</p>

<p>6. It may be added, that it was probably in 1739 that
Wesley published an extract of his journal, from his embarking
for Georgia, October 14, 1735, to his return to London,
February 1, 1737; but of this we are not certain, the first
edition being without date.</p>

<p>The substance of this has been already given, and hence
we pass, at once, to the year 1740.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740<br />

Age 37</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Moravian wranglings brought Wesley to the metropolis
in 1739; and, on the 3rd of January following,
he left his friends, still “subverting one another’s souls by
idle controversies and strife of words;” and came to Bristol
on January 9.</p>

<p>Here he purposed to remain; but within a month he was
back to London. A young surgeon, of the name of Snowde,
had met in Bristol a man of the name of Ramsey, who in
a state of destitution and distress had applied to Wesley for
relief. Wesley employed him in writing and in keeping
accounts for him, and afterwards in teaching a school instituted
by the Bristol society.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Ramsey brought the young
surgeon to hear Wesley preach. Both were rascals, and
availed themselves of an opportunity of stealing £30 that had
been collected towards building Kingswood school. Snowde
went off to London; fell in with his old acquaintance;
committed highway robbery; was arrested, tried, and condemned
to die. While in Newgate, awaiting the execution
of his sentence, he wrote to a friend, adjuring Wesley, “by
the living God,” to come and see him before his death.
Wesley, who had been robbed so sacrilegiously, started off,
on a journey of more than two hundred miles, purposely to
visit the convict thief. He found him apparently penitent,
and having only a week to live. On the day before his
sentence was to be executed, the poor creature wrote:—“I
trust God has forgiven me all my sins, washing them away in
the blood of the Lamb.” Next morning a reprieve was sent,
and, six weeks afterwards, he was ordered for transportation.
Whether Wesley assisted in obtaining the commutation of
his sentence we have no means of knowing;<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> but as soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
the affair was settled he returned to Bristol; where, with the
exception of a brief interval of about a week’s duration, he
continued until the month of June. The rest of the year,
excepting about three weeks, was spent in London.</p>

<p>In Bristol, the work, in its outward aspects, was greatly
altered. Wesley writes:—“Convictions sink deeper and
deeper; love and joy are more calm, even, and steady.”</p>

<p>Still there were a few instances similar to those that had
occurred in the previous year. On January 13, while he was
administering the sacrament at the house of a sick person in
Kingswood, a woman “sunk down as dead.” A week after,
she was “filled with the love of God, and with all peace and
joy in believing.” On January 24, after he had preached in
Bristol, another woman caught hold of him, crying:—“I have
sinned beyond forgiveness. I have been cursing you in my
heart, and blaspheming God. I am damned; I know it; I
feel it; I am in hell; I have hell in my heart.” On April 3,
the congregations in Bristol were remarkably visited; and
“the cries of desire, joy, and love were on every side.” Five
weeks after, another phase of excitement was presented. The
people began to laugh; and, though it was a great grief to
them, the laughing spirit was stronger than they were able to
resist. One woman, who was known to be no dissembler,
“sometimes laughed till she was almost strangled; then she
broke out into cursing and blaspheming; then stamped and
struggled with incredible strength, so that four or five could
scarce hold her; then cried out, ‘O eternity, eternity! O
that I had no soul! O that I had never been born!’ At
last, she faintly called on Christ to help her,” and her excitement
ceased. Most of the society were convinced, that those
who laughed had no power to help it; but there were two
exceptions: Elizabeth B—— and Anne H——. At length,
says Wesley, “God suffered Satan to teach them better.
Both of them were suddenly seized in the same manner as
the rest, and laughed whether they would or no, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
without ceasing. Thus they continued for two days, a
spectacle to all; and were then, upon prayer made for them,
delivered in a moment.”</p>

<p>What are we to think of this? Wesley attributes it to
Satan, and, in confirmation of his opinion, recites an instance
which had occurred in his own history while at Oxford.
According to their custom on Sundays, he and his brother
Charles were walking in the meadows, singing psalms, when
all at once Charles burst into a loud fit of laughter. Wesley
writes:—“I asked him if he was distracted; and began to
be angry. But presently I began to laugh as loud as he; nor
could we possibly refrain, though we were ready to tear
ourselves in pieces. We were forced to go home without
singing another line.”</p>

<p>Amidst all this, however, there were happy deaths at Bristol.
Margaret Thomas died in the highest triumph of faith, her
will swallowed up in the will of God, and her hope full of
immortality.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> And one of the Kingswood converts “longed
to be dissolved and to be with Christ;” some of her last
words being, “I know His arms are round me; for His arms
are like the rainbow, they go round heaven and earth.”
These were among the first Methodists that entered heaven;
and, no doubt, it was deaths like theirs which prompted not a
few of the triumphant funereal hymns that gushed so exultingly
from the poetic soul of Wesley’s brother.</p>

<p>The New Room at Bristol, as the first Methodist meeting-house
was called, was now opened. Wesley expounded and
preached daily, choosing for exposition the Acts of the
Apostles, and for sermons the greatest texts of the New
Testament. He was also one of the most active of
philanthropists. The severity of the frost in January threw
hundreds out of work, and reduced them to a state bordering
on starvation; but Wesley made collections, and fed a
hundred, and sometimes a hundred and fifty, hungry wretches
in a day. He visited Bristol Bridewell, and tried to benefit
and to comfort poor prisoners, till the commanding officer
gave strict orders that neither Wesley nor any of his followers
should in future be admitted, because he and they were all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
atheists. Of these same Bristol “atheists,” Wesley himself
writes, “They were indeed as little children, not artful, not
wise in their own eyes, not doting on controversy and strife
of words; but truly determined to know nothing save Jesus
Christ, and Him crucified.” Such they were when Wesley
left them at the beginning of the month of June; and such
his brother found them. “O what simplicity,” remarks Charles
Wesley, “is in this childlike people! O that our London
brethren would come to school at Kingswood! These <i>are</i>
what they <i>pretend</i> to be. God knows their poverty; but they
are rich.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately broils generally broke out where Charles was
pastor. This was his affliction, if not his fault. Before June
was ended, he began to “rebuke sharply” some who thought
themselves elect. He also read his journal to the bands “as
an antidote to stillness.” When some of the people cried out,
he “bade them to be quiet.” He reproved Hannah Barrow
before the assembled society at Kingswood; and exercised
discipline upon others. All this might be proper and expedient;
but it was evidently of little use; for, when his
brother returned to Bristol on September 1, his first sermon
was addressed to backsliders. He met with one who had
become wise far above what is written; and another who had
been lifted up with the abundance of joy God had given her,
and had fallen into blasphemies and vain imaginations.
Later in the year, he found many “lame and turned out of
the way.” There were “jealousies and misunderstandings.”
There had been a Kingswood riot, on account of the dearness
of corn. Charles Wesley rushed into the midst of it, and,
finding a number of his converted colliers, who had been
forced to join the disturbers of the public peace, he “gleaned
a few from every company,” and “marched with them singing
to the school,” where they held a two hours’ prayer-meeting,
that God would chain the lion. He had to warn the people
against apostasy. Some could not refrain from railing. John
Cennick, in December, told Wesley that he was not able to
agree with him, because he failed to preach the truth respecting
election. The predestinarians formed themselves into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
party, “to have a church within themselves, and to give
themselves the sacrament in bread and water.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> So that
when Wesley, on December 26, went to Kingswood, in order
to preach at the usual hour, there was not more than half-a-dozen
of the Kingswood people to hear him, all the others
having become the followers of Calvinistic Cennick.</p>

<p>There were other troubles in Bristol, in 1740. After several
disturbances in the month of March, the mob, on the 1st of
April, filled the street and court and alleys round the place
where Wesley was expounding, and shouted, cursed, and
swore most fearfully. A number of the rioters were arrested;
and, within a fortnight, one of them had hanged himself; a
second was seized with serious illness, and sent to desire
Wesley’s prayers; and a third came to him, confessing that
he had been hired and made drunk to create disturbance,
but, on coming to the place, found himself deprived of speech
and power.</p>

<p>Concurrent with this unpleasantness, other parties used their
utmost endeavours to prejudice the mind of Howel Harris,
gleaning up idle stories concerning Wesley, and retailing
them in Wales. “And yet these,” says Wesley, “are good
Christians! these whisperers, talebearers, backbiters, evil
speakers! Just such Christians as murderers or adulterers!”
The curate of Penreul averred, upon his personal knowledge,
that Wesley was a papist. Another man, a popish priest
named Beon, while Wesley was preaching in Bristol, cried
out, “Thou art a hypocrite, a devil, an enemy to the Church.
This is false doctrine. It is not the doctrine of the Church.
It is damnable doctrine. It is the doctrine of devils.” At
Upton, the bells were rung to drown his voice. At Temple
church, the converted colliers, and even Wesley’s brother
Charles, were repelled from the sacramental table, and
threatened with arrest. William Seward, the friend and travelling
companion of George Whitefield, came to Bristol, and
renounced the friendship of the two Wesleys, “in bitter words
of hatred;” and Mr. Tucker preached against them, and condemned
their irregularities in reforming and converting men.</p>

<p>So much respecting Bristol: let us turn to London. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
the first five months, in 1740, Charles Wesley was the pastor of
the London Moravians and Methodists, but conjoined with him
was Philip Henry Molther, who was the Moravian favourite.</p>

<p>Molther was a native of Alsace, and a divinity student in
the university of Jena. In 1737, he became the private tutor
of Zinzendorf’s only son, and instructed him in French and
music. On the 18th of October, 1739, he arrived in London,
on his way to Pennsylvania. Bohler had left England; and
the society in Fetter Lane was under the care of the two
Wesleys.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Being an ordained Moravian minister, the people
were anxious to hear Molther preach. At first, he spoke to
them in Latin, with the help of an interpreter; but shortly
was able to make himself understood in English. He was
not satisfied with the Fetter Lane Moravians, for, says he,
they had “adopted many most extraordinary usages.” The
first time he entered their meeting, he was alarmed and
almost terror stricken at “their sighing and groaning, their
whining and howling, which strange proceeding they called
the demonstration of the Spirit of power.” Molther, however,
soon became extremely popular. Not only was the meeting-house
in Fetter Lane filled with hearers, but the courtyard as
well. Within a fortnight after his arrival, Wesley came from
Bristol, “and the first person he met with was one whom he
had left strong in faith, and zealous of good works; but who
now told him, that Molther had fully convinced her she never
had any faith at all, and had advised her, till she received
faith, to be still, ceasing from outward works.” This was on
November 1; and what followed, to the end of 1739, has
been related already.</p>

<p>In January, 1740, Molther requested Wesley to furnish him
with a translation of a German hymn; and the magnificent
one beginning, “Now I have found the ground wherein,” was
the result. For this, Molther, in a letter dated January 25,
1740, thanks the translator, and says, “I like it better than
any other hymn I have seen in English.” He then adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—I love you with a real love in the wounds of
my Redeemer; and whenever I remember England, and the labourers in
the kingdom of our Saviour therein, you come in my mind; and I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
but pray our Lord, that He may open to you the hidden treasures of the
mysteries of the gospel, which, as I have seen by two of your discourses,
you want to know and to experience a little more in its depths. It is a
blessed thing to preach out of that fulness, and by experimental notions
of the blood of Christ. If you seek for this as an empty, poor sinner, it
undoubtedly will be given you, because it is only for such; and when we
cannot reach it with our desires, we may surely believe that our hearts
are not empty vessels. This is a very great and important thing, and a
mystery as well as all other things, unless the Lord hath revealed them
unto us. I wish that our Saviour, for His own sake, may give you an
entire satisfaction in this matter, and fill up your heart with a solid knowledge
of His bloody atonement. My love to your brother Charles and all
your brethren. I am your affectionate and unworthy brother,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">P. H. Molther</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>From this vague and misty epistle, it is evident that the
views of Molther were not entertained by Wesley. For this
we are thankful. Who can tell what is meant by loving a
man “in the wounds of the Redeemer”? and by having the
heart filled “up with a solid knowledge of His bloody atonement”?
With all his imperfections, Wesley had learned to
express his ideas in language much preferable to this.</p>

<p>Molther remained in the metropolis till about September,
1740, when, instead of proceeding to Pennsylvania as he intended,
he was recalled to Germany. During this ten months‘residence, his diligence was exemplary, but its results disastrous.
In the daytime, he visited from house to house. At
nights, he met the bands, and often preached. James
Hutton, in a letter to Zinzendorf, dated March 14, 1740,
writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Most beloved Bishop and Brother</span>,—</p>

<p>“My heart is poor, and I feel continually, that the blood of Christ
will be a great gift, when I can obtain it to overstream my heart.</p>

<p>“At London, Molther preaches four times a week in English to great
numbers; and, from morning till night, he is engaged in conversing with
the souls, and labouring to bring them into better order. They get a
great confidence towards him, and many of them began to be in great
sorrow when they expected him to be about to go away. I humbly beg
you would leave him with us, some time longer at the least. He continues
very simple, and improves exceedingly in the English language. The souls
are exceedingly thirsty, and hang on his words. He has had many blessings.
The false foundation many had made has been discovered, and now
speedily the one only foundation, Christ Jesus, will be laid in many souls.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“John Wesley, being resolved to <i>do</i> all things himself, and having told
many souls that they were justified, who have since discovered themselves
to be otherwise, and having mixed the works of the law with the
gospel as <i>means</i> of grace, is at enmity against the Brethren. Envy is not
extinct in him. His heroes falling every day almost into poor sinners,
frightens him; but, at London, the spirit of the Brethren prevails against
him. In a conference lately, where he was speaking that souls ought to
go to church as often as they could, I besought him to be easy and not
disturb himself, and I would go to church as often as he would meet me
there; but he would not insist on it. He seeks occasion against the
Brethren, but I hope he will find none in us. I desired him simply to
keep to his office in the body of Christ, <i>i.e.</i> to awaken souls in preaching,
but not to pretend to lead them to Christ. But he will have the glory of
doing all things. I fear, by-and-by, he will be an open enemy of Christ
and His church. His brother Charles is coming to London, determined
to oppose all such as shall not use the means of grace, after his sense of
them. I am determined to be still. I will let our Saviour govern this
whirlwind. Both John Wesley and Charles are dangerous snares to
many young women. Several are in love with them. I wish they were
married to some good sisters; though I would not give them one of mine,
even if I had many.</p>

<p>“In Yorkshire, Ingham and W. Delamotte are united to the Brethren.
Some thousand souls are awakened. They are a very simple people.
Some months will be necessary to bring them into order, and Toltschig
will not hurry as we Englishmen do.</p>

<p>“At Oxford, some good souls at first could not be reconciled with lay
teaching, stillness, etc.; but now some will come to Christ. About six
are in a fine way. Fifty, or thereabouts, come to hear Viney three times
a week, and he gets their hearts more and more. He is poor in spirit,
and gradually returns to first principles.</p>

<p>“At Bristol, the souls are wholly under C. Wesley, who leads them into
many things, which they will find a difficulty to come out of; for, at
present, I believe, it will not be possible to help them. First their leader
must feel his heart, or the souls must find him out.</p>

<p>“In Wales, some thousands are stirred up. They are an exceedingly
simple and honest people, but they are taught the Calvinistic scheme.
However, the young man, Howel Harris, who has been the great instrument
in this work, is very teachable and humble, and loves the
Brethren.</p>

<p>“My father and mother are in the same state, or rather in a worse.
My sister is much worse than ever. But, when grace can be received,
they will be blessed instruments, and bring great glory to Him in whose
heart’s blood I desire to be washed.</p>

<p>This is a long, loose letter; but important, as descriptive of
the Wesleys and of the work of God in general, from the
standpoint of the Moravians. They evidently thought themselves
the prime, if not the only, instruments in the present
great revival; and this, excepting Scotland, Wales, and
Bristol, to a great extent, was true. The work they had
already done and contemplated was marvellous. A curious
letter, dated December, 1739, is published in Doddridge’s
Diary and Correspondence, vol. iii., p. 265, in which Zinzendorf
addresses Doddridge as “the very reverend man, much
beloved in the bowels of the blessed Redeemer, pastor of
Northampton, and vigilant theologian.” Recounting the
triumphs of the gospel, he tells the Northampton pastor that
Switzerland has heard the truth; Greenland resounds with
the gospel; thirty Caffrarians had been baptized; and
a thousand negroes in the West Indies. Savannah, the
Carolinas, Pennsylvania, Berbice, and Surinam were expecting
fruit; ten or fifteen heathen tribes in Virginia were
about to be visited; Ceylon and Lapland had both been
reached; the gospel was being preached in Russia; Wallachia
was succoured; Constantinople was blessed; through the
whole of Germany the churches were preparing for Christ;
and the Brethren were about to go to the East Indies, to
Persian Magi, and to New York savages. All this had been
done within the last twenty years. The Moravians, like
a hive of bees, were all workers. By the grace of God, they
had accomplished wonders; and yet, in London at least,
through false teaching, they were in danger of being wrecked.
The Wesleys tried to keep them right; but, in doing so,
incurred censure instead of receiving thanks. A long extract
from one of James Hutton’s letters has just been given; and
another must be added. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“John Wesley, displeased at not being thought so much of as formerly,
and offended with the easy way of salvation as taught by the Brethren,
publicly spoke against our doctrines in his sermons, and his friends did
the same. In June, 1740, he formed his Foundery society, in opposition
to the one which met at Fetter Lane, and which had become a Moravian
society. Many of our usual hearers consequently left us, especially
the females. We asked his forgiveness, if in anything we had aggrieved
him, but he continued full of wrath, accusing the Brethren that they,
by dwelling exclusively on the doctrine of faith, neglected the law, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
zeal for sanctification. In short, he became our declared opponent,
and the two societies of the Brethren and Methodists thenceforward
were separated, and became independent of each other.”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is a painful subject; and hitherto, by both Moravian
and Methodist historians, has been touched with a tender
hand; but men have a right to know the foibles and follies of
the good and great, as well as the virtues and victories for
which they have been wreathed with honour. Besides, the
recent publication of the memoirs of James Hutton renders
it requisite that something more should be said respecting
the squabbles of 1740.</p>

<p>In the extracts just given, Hutton accuses Wesley of telling
men that they were justified when they were not; of envy;
of being at enmity against the Moravians; of being able to
awaken sinners, but not to lead them to the Saviour; of being
a dangerous snare to young females; and of being displeased
at the decline of his popularity, and offended with the
Brethren’s easy method of salvation. Is all this true? Let
us see. The Moravian statements have been given with
the utmost honesty; let the reader take the Methodist statements
on the other side.</p>

<p>Be it borne in mind, that Wesley was one of the original
members of the Fetter Lane society, founded on the 1st of
May, 1738; whereas Molther was first introduced among them
in the month of October, 1739. Uneasiness and cavils sprung
up immediately after Molther’s arrival; and, before the year
was ended, Wesley had to come twice from Bristol to try
to check germinating evils, and to put wrong things right.</p>

<p>On New Year’s day, 1740, he writes: “I endeavoured
to explain to our brethren the true, Christian, scriptural
stillness, by largely unfolding these words, ‘Be still, and
know that I am God.’” The day after, he “earnestly besought
them to ‘stand in the old paths.’ They all seemed convinced,
and cried to God to heal their backslidings.” Wesley adds:
“He sent forth such a spirit of peace and love, as we had
not known for many months before.” Next day, January 3,
Wesley set out for Bristol, and returned a month afterwards.
He now found his old friends pleading for “a reservedness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
and closeness of conversation,” which perplexed him. He
was told that “many of them, not content with leaving off
the ordinances of God themselves, were continually troubling
those that did not, and disputing with them, whether they
would or no.” He “expostulated with them, and besought
them to refrain from perplexing the minds of those who still
waited for God in the ways of His own appointment.”</p>

<p>Thus he left them on the 3rd of March. Meanwhile, “poor
perverted Mr. Simpson” declared to Charles Wesley, that
no good was to be got by what he called the <i>means of grace</i>,
neither was there any obligation to use them; and that most
of the Brethren had cast them off. Charles, accompanied by
Thomas Maxfield, called on Molther, who talked “against
running after ordinances. They parted as they met, without
prayer or singing; for the time for such exercises was past.”
Maxfield was scandalized, and Charles Wesley foresaw that
a separation was unavoidable. On Easter day, when preaching
at the Foundery, he appealed to the society, and asked,
“Who hath bewitched you, that you should let go your
Saviour, and deny you ever knew Him?” A burst of sorrow
followed; but, on going to Mr. Bowers’, in the evening, to
meet the bands, the door was shut against him; and proceeding
to Mr. Bray’s, the brazier, he was threatened with
expulsion from the Moravian society. The day after, at
Fetter Lane, Simpson reproved him for mentioning himself
in preaching, and for preaching up the ordinances. He
answered, that he should not ask him, or any of the Brethren,
how an ambassador of Christ should preach. He adds: “I
went home, weary, wounded, bruised, and faint, through
the contradiction of sinners; <i>poor</i> sinners, as they call themselves,—these
heady, violent, fierce contenders for stillness. I
could not bear the thought of meeting them again.” Simpson
said, “‘No soul <i>can</i> be washed in the blood of Christ, unless
it first be brought to one in whom Christ is fully formed.
But there are only <i>two such ministers</i> in London, Bell and
Molther.’ Is not this robbing Christ of His glory, and making
His creature <i>necessary</i> to Him in His peculiar work of
salvation? First perish Molther, Bell, and all mankind, and
sink into nothing, that Christ may be all in all. A new
commandment, called ‘<i>stillness</i>,’ has repealed all God’s com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>mandments,
and given a full indulgence to corrupted nature.
The <i>still</i> ones rage against <i>me</i>; for my brother, they <i>say</i>,
had consented to their pulling down the ordinances, and here
come I, and build them up again.”</p>

<p>During the week, Simpson called upon Charles Wesley,
and “laid down his two postulatums:—1. The ordinances
are not commands. 2. It is impossible to doubt after justification.”
In a society meeting, at the Foundery, he further
stated that “no unjustified person ought to receive the sacrament;
for, doing so, he ate and drank his own damnation;”
and J. Bray declared, that it was “impossible for any one
to be a true Christian out of the Moravian church.”</p>

<p>Simpson wrote to Wesley wishing him to return to London;
and, on April 23, he came, and found confusion worse confounded
than ever. “Believers,” said Simpson, “are not
subject to ordinances; and unbelievers have nothing to do
with them. They ought to be still; otherwise they will be
unbelievers as long as they live.” Wesley writes: “After a
fruitless dispute of about two hours, I returned home with a
heavy heart. In the evening, our society met; but it was
cold, weary, heartless, dead. I found nothing of brotherly
love among them now; but a harsh, dry, heavy, stupid spirit.
For two hours, they looked one at another, when they looked
up at all, as if one half of them was afraid of the other.”
“The first hour passed in dumb show; the next in trifles not
worth naming.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>The two Wesleys went to Molther, who explicitly affirmed,
that no one has any faith while he has any doubt; and that
none are justified till they are sanctified. He also maintained,
that, until men obtain clean hearts and are justified, they
must refrain from using the means of grace, so called;
but, after that, they are at perfect liberty to use them, or to
use them not, as they deem expedient. They are <i>designed
only</i> for believers; but are not <i>enjoined</i> even upon them.</p>

<p>Wesley was at his wits’ end; numbers came to him every
day, once full of peace and love, but now plunged into doubts
and fears. Just at this juncture, his brother printed his fine
hymn, of twenty-three stanzas, entitled “The Means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
Grace,” and circulated it “as an antidote to stillness.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
“Many,” said Charles, “insist that a part of their Christian
calling is liberty <i>from</i> obeying, not liberty <i>to</i> obey. ‘The
unjustified,’ say they, ‘are <i>to be still</i>; that is, not to search
the Scriptures, not to pray, not to communicate, not to do
good, not to endeavour, not to desire; for it is impossible to
use means, without trusting in them.’ Their practice is agreeable
to their principles. Lazy and proud themselves, bitter
and censorious towards others, they trample upon the ordinances,
and despise the commands of Christ.”</p>

<p>Wesley preached from the text, “Thou fool, that which thou
sowest is not quickened, except it die;” and “demonstrated to
the society, that the ordinances are both means of grace, and
commands of God.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> It was also probably at this period that
he preached his able and discriminating sermon on the same
subject, and which is published in his collected works. He
specifies as the chief <i>means of grace</i>:—1. Prayer. 2. Searching
the Scriptures; which implies reading, hearing, and meditating
thereon. 3. Receiving the Lord’s supper. He allows,
however, that, if these <i>means</i> are used as a kind of <i>commutation</i>
for the religion they were designed to serve, it is difficult
to find words to express the enormous folly and wickedness
of thus keeping Christianity out of the heart by the very
means which were ordained to bring it in. All outward
means whatever, if separate from the Spirit of God, cannot
profit the man using them. They possess no intrinsic power;
and God is equally able to work by any, or by none at all.
Wesley then proceeds to prove from Scripture, that, “all who
desire the grace of God are to wait for it in the means which
He hath ordained; in using, not in laying them aside.” He
likewise answers the following objections:—1. You cannot use
these means without <i>trusting</i> in them. 2. This is seeking
salvation by works. 3. Christ is the only means of grace.
4. The Scripture directs us to <i>wait</i> for salvation. 5. God has
appointed another way—“Stand <i>still</i>, and see the salvation
of God.” Finally, Wesley concludes thus:—“1. Retain a lively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
sense that God is above all means, and can convey His grace,
either in or out of any of the means which He hath appointed.
2. Be deeply impressed with the fact, that there is no <i>power
nor merit</i> in any of the means. The <i>opus operatum</i>, the mere
work done, profiteth nothing. Do it because God bids it.
3. In and through every outward thing, seek God alone, looking
singly to the <i>power</i> of His Spirit, and the <i>merits</i> of His
Son.” The whole sermon is intensely <i>Wesleyan</i>; full of
keenly defined and powerfully enforced Scripture truths.
Let the reader read it: it will benefit both his head and
heart; and, perused in the light of these painful facts, it
possesses historic interest of great importance. Such a sermon
must have had a powerful influence at such a time, and bold
was the man, who, in the midst of such disputers, had the
fidelity to preach it.</p>

<p>It was a time of great anxiety. The work in London was
in danger of being wrecked; and, more than that, some of
Wesley’s oldest and most trusted friends, in this afflictive
emergency, proved unfaithful.</p>

<p>The Rev. George Stonehouse, vicar of Islington, was converted
in 1738, chiefly through the instrumentality of Charles
Wesley, who, for a time, officiated as his curate. Many were
the warm-hearted meetings, held, by the first Methodists, in the
vicar’s house. His affection for the two Wesleys was great;
and, in November 1738, when they were forsaken by all their
friends, and well-nigh penniless, he offered to find them home
and maintenance; and yet, six months afterwards, he yielded
to his churchwardens, and allowed Charles Wesley to be
excluded from his church. Imbibing Molther’s heresies,
Stonehouse sold his living, married the only daughter of Sir
John Crispe, joined the Moravians, and retired to Sherborne,
in the west of England, where he fitted up a place capable of
accommodating five hundred people, in which to hold Moravian
meetings. In 1745, he had a lovefeast, the room being
grandly illuminated with thirty-seven candles adorned with
flowers; and all the sisters present being dressed in German
fashion. Shortly after this, he abandoned the Brethren altogether,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
and appears henceforth to have spent his days in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
inglorious <i>stillness</i>, enjoying the benefits of a <i>quiet</i> religion
and a harmless life.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Wesley sought counsel of his friend Ingham, and received
in reply the following letter, full of piety and mistiness, and
now for the first time published.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Osset</span>, <i>February 20, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—You ask, what are the marks of a person that
is justified, but not sealed?</p>

<p>“I cannot give you any certain, infallible marks. One to whom the
Lord has given the gift of discerning could tell; but without that gift
none else can know surely. However, it may be said, that justified
persons are meek, simple, and childlike; they have doubts and fears;
they are in a wilderness state; and, in this state, they are to be kept <i>still
and quiet</i>, to search more deeply into their hearts, so that they may
become more and more humble. They are likewise to depend wholly
upon Christ; and to be kept from confusion; for, if they come into
confusion, they receive inconceivable damage.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, if they continue meek, gentle, still,—if they search
into their hearts, and depend on Christ, they will find their hearts to be
sweetly drawn after Him; they will begin to loathe and abhor sin, and to
hunger and thirst after righteousness; they will get strength daily; Christ
will begin to manifest Himself by degrees; the darkness will vanish, and
the day-star will arise in their hearts. Thus they will go on from strength
to strength, till they become strong; and then they will begin to see
things clearly; and so, by degrees, they will come to have the assurance
of faith.</p>

<p>“You ask whether, in this intermediate state, they are ‘children of
wrath,’ or ‘heirs of the promises’?</p>

<p>“Without doubt, they are children of God, and in a state of salvation.
A child may be heir to an estate, before it can speak, or know what an
estate is; so we may be heirs of heaven before we know it, or are made
sure of it. However, the assurance of faith is to be sought after. It may
be attained; and it will be, by all who go forward.</p>

<p>“We must first be deeply humble and poor in spirit. We must have
a fixed and abiding sense of our own weakness and unworthiness, corruption,
sin, and misery. This it is to be a <i>poor sinner</i>.</p>

<p>“If I were with you, I would explain things more largely; but I am a
novice; I am but a beginner; a babe in Christ. If you go amongst the
Brethren, they are good guides; but, after all, we must be taught of God,
and have experience in our own hearts. May the Spirit of truth lead us
into all truth!</p>

<p>This is a curious letter, and will help to cast light on
some of the expressions which Wesley himself had used concerning
his own experience. As yet, the Methodists had
much to learn. Meanwhile, Ingham and Howel Harris came
to London. Charles Wesley says, the latter, in his preaching,
proved himself a son of thunder and of consolation. Cavilling,
however, followed. Honest, plain, undesigning James Hutton
“was all tergiversation, and turned into a subtle, close, ambiguous
Loyola;” while Richard Bell, watch-case maker,
seemed to think, that he and Molther and another were all
the church that Christ had in England. A man of the name
of Ridley rendered himself famous by saying, “You may as
well go to hell for praying as for thieving;” and John Browne
asserted, “If we read, the devil reads with us; if we pray, he
prays with us; if we go to church or sacrament, he goes
with us.”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Ingham also, as well as Harris, “honestly withstood the
deluded Brethren; contradicted their favourite errors; and
constrained them to be <i>still</i>.” In the Fetter Lane society,
he bore a noble testimony for the ordinances of God; but
the answer was, “You are blind, and speak of the things you
know not.” Wesley preached a series of sermons—1. On the
delusion, that “weak faith is no faith.” 2. On the bold
affirmation, that there is but one commandment in the New
Testament, namely, “to believe.” 3. On the point, that
Christians are subject to the ordinances of Christ. 4. On
the fact, that a man may be justified without being entirely
sanctified. These discourses were followed by five others,
on reading the Scriptures, prayer, the Lord’s supper, and
good works.</p>

<p>The result was increased commotion. Some said, “We
believers are no more bound to obey, than the subjects of the
king of England are bound to obey the laws of the king
of France.” Bell declared that, for a man not born of God to
read the Scriptures, pray, or come to the Lord’s table, was
deadly poison. And Wesley, after a short debate, was prohibited
preaching at Fetter Lane.</p>

<p>This brought matters to a crisis. Wesley had done all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
he could to correct the growing errors; but Molther was
a greater favourite than Wesley; and the man, who had
founded Fetter Lane society, was now, by Moravian votes,
commanded to go about his business, and to leave the pulpit
to his German superiors.</p>

<p>The thing had become an intolerable evil; and, at all
hazards, the heresies must be checked. Substantially they
may be reduced to two:—1. That there are no degrees of
faith; or, in other words, that there is no justifying faith
where there is any doubt or fear; or, in other words (for
we feel it difficult to gripe such an abortive dogma), no man
believes and is justified, unless, in the full sense of the
expression, he is sanctified, and is possessed of a clean heart.
2. That to search the Scriptures, to pray, or to communicate,
before we have faith, is to seek salvation by works; and such
works must be laid aside before faith can be received.</p>

<p>This is not the place to confute such errors. Suffice it
to say, that, before half-a-dozen years had passed, the London
Moravians dropped the very doctrines, for opposing which
Wesley was expelled from preaching in Fetter Lane. Their
<i>stillness</i> was declared to mean, that “man cannot attain to
salvation by his own wisdom, strength, righteousness, goodness,
merits, or works. When he applies for it, he must cast
away all dependence upon everything of his own, and, trusting
only to the mercy of God, through the merits of Christ, he
must thus <i>quietly wait</i> for God’s salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> This is a
doctrine to which Wesley raised no objection; but it was
not the doctrine of Molther, Browne, Bell, Bray, and Bowers,
in 1740. Then as to the doctrine concerning degrees in faith,
it is right to add, that such a dogma was never taught by the
general authorities of the Moravian <i>church</i>; but it was taught
by Spangenberg, Molther, Stonehouse, and other Moravians
in London,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> the result being the disastrous confusion to which
we are now adverting. Indeed, it is a notable fact, that, only
two months after the Fetter Lane disruption, Wesley himself
clears the Moravian <i>church</i> from the aspersion, that it held
such heresies. They were the spawn of foolish fanatics,
who regarded themselves Moravians, but were hardly worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
of the name. On September 29, 1740, Wesley having stated
what the errors were, observes:—“In flat opposition to this,
I assert: 1. That a man may have a degree of justifying
faith, before he is wholly freed from all doubt and fear;
and before he has, in the full, proper sense, a new, a clean
heart. 2. That a man may use the ordinances of God,
the Lord’s supper in particular, before he has such a faith as
excludes all doubt and fear, and implies a new, a clean heart.
3. I further assert, that I learned this, not only from the
English, but also from the Moravian church; and I hereby
openly and earnestly call upon that church, and upon Count
Zinzendorf in particular, to correct me, and explain themselves,
if I have misunderstood or misrepresented them.”
Wesley thus puts the blame on the right shoulders. It was
not the Moravian <i>church</i>, but a few of its foolish ministers
and members, at Fetter Lane, that circulated these heresies.</p>

<p>What was the result? If the Fetter Lane society did not
exclude Wesley from their membership, they, on the 16th
of July, expelled him from their pulpit; and hence, four days
afterwards, he went with Mr. Seward to their lovefeast,
and, at its conclusion, read a paper stating the errors into
which they had fallen, and concluding thus:—“I believe these
assertions to be flatly contrary to the word of God. I have
warned you hereof again and again, and besought you to
turn back to the ‘law and the testimony.’ I have borne with
you long, hoping you would turn. But, as I find you more
and more confirmed in the error of your ways, nothing now
remains, but that I should give you up to God. You that are
of the same judgment, follow me.”</p>

<p>Without saying more, he then silently withdrew, eighteen
or nineteen of the society following him.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, he received a letter from one of
the Brethren in Germany, advising him and his brother to
deliver up the “instruction of poor souls” to the Moravians;
“for you,” adds the writer, “only instruct them in such errors,
that they will be damned at last. St. Peter justly describes
you, who ‘have eyes full of adultery, and cannot cease from
sin;’ and take upon you to guide unstable souls, and lead
them in the way of damnation.”</p>

<p>The day following, the seceding society, numbering about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
twenty-five men and fifty women, met for the first time, at
the Foundery, instead of at Fetter Lane; and so the Methodist
society was founded on July 23, 1740.</p>

<p>A fortnight later, Wesley, “a presbyter of the church of
God in England,” wrote a long letter “to the church of
God at Herrnhuth,” in which he states, that, though some
of the Moravians had pronounced him “a child of the devil
and a servant of corruption,” yet, he was now taking the
liberty of speaking freely and plainly concerning things in
the Moravian church which he deemed unscriptural. He
enumerates the heresies which have been so often mentioned.
He tells them, that a Moravian preacher, in his public expounding,
said: “As many go to hell by praying as by
thieving.” Another had said, “I knew a man who received
a great gift while leaning over the back of a chair; but
kneeling down to give God thanks, he lost it immediately
through doing so.” He charges the Moravians with exalting
themselves and despising others, and declares, that he scarce
ever heard a Moravian owning his church or himself to be
wrong in anything. They spoke of their church as if it were
infallible, and some of them set it up as the judge of all the
earth, of all persons and of all doctrines, and maintained that
there were no true Christians out of it. Like the modern
Mystics, they mixed much of man’s wisdom with the wisdom
of God, and philosophised on almost every part of the plain
religion of the Bible. They talked much against mixing
nature with grace, and against mimicking the power of the
Holy Ghost. They cautioned the brethren against animal
joy, against natural love of one another, and against selfish
love of God. “My brethren,” concludes Wesley, “whether
ye will hear, or whether ye will forbear, I have now delivered
my own soul. And this I have chosen to do in an artless
manner, that if anything should come home to your hearts,
the effect might evidently flow, not from the wisdom of man,
but from the power of God.”</p>

<p>On September 1, Charles Wesley wrote to Whitefield in
America, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The great work goes forward, maugre all the opposition of earth and
hell. The most violent opposers of all are our own brethren of Fetter
Lane, that were. We have gathered up between twenty and thirty from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
the wreck, and transplanted them to the Foundery. The remnant has
taken root downward, and borne fruit upwards. A little one is become a
thousand. They grow in grace, particularly in humility, and in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus. Innumerable have been the devices to
scatter this little flock. The roaring lion is turned a <i>still</i> lion, and makes
havoc of the church by means of our spiritual brethren. They are
indefatigable in bringing us off from our ‘carnal ordinances,’ and speak
with such wisdom from beneath, that, if it were possible, they would
deceive the very elect. The Quakers, they say, are exactly right; and,
indeed, the principles of the one naturally lead to the other. For instance,
take our poor friend Morgan. One week he and his wife were at J. Bray’s,
under the teaching of the <i>still</i> brethren. Soon after, he turned Quaker,
and is now a celebrated preacher among them. All these things shall
be for the furtherance of the gospel.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whitefield’s reply to this is unknown; but on November
24 he wrote as follows to James Hutton:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have lately conversed closely with Peter Bohler. Alas! we differ
widely in many respects; therefore, to avoid disputations and jealousies
on both sides, it is best to carry on the work of God apart. The divisions
among the Brethren sometimes grieve, but do not surprise me. How can
it be otherwise, when teachers do not think and speak the same things?
God grant we may keep up a cordial, undissembled love towards each
other, notwithstanding our different opinions. O, how I long for heaven!
Surely, there will be no divisions, no strife there, except who shall sing
with most affection to the Lamb that sitteth upon the throne. Dear
James, there I hope to meet thee.”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Here, for the present, we leave the London Moravians.
We say, for the present, for unfortunately we shall have to
recur to them.</p>

<p>The year 1740 was a year of troubles. A month previous
to the Fetter Lane secession, a man of the name of Acourt
bitterly complained, that he had been refused admission to the
society-meeting, by order of Charles Wesley, because he differed
from the Wesleys in opinion. “What opinion do you
mean?” asked Wesley. He answered, “That of election. I
hold, a certain number is elected from eternity; and these
must and shall be saved; and the rest of mankind must and
shall be damned; and many of your society hold the same.”
Here we have another bone of contention.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Whitefield’s visit to America, he and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
Wesleys had laboured in union and harmony, without entering
into the discussion of particular opinions; but now, across the
Atlantic, Whitefield became acquainted with a number of
godly Calvinistic ministers, who recommended to him the
writings of the puritan divines, which he read with great
avidity, and, as a consequence, soon embraced their sentiments.
Secrecy was no part of Whitefield’s mental or moral
nature. With the utmost frankness, he wrote to Wesley, informing
him of his new opinions.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Wesley was the son of parents who held the doctrines of
election and reprobation in abhorrence. While at college, he
had thoroughly sifted the subject for himself, and, in letters to
his mother, expressed his views in the strongest language.
Whitefield, on the contrary, was no theologian. His heart
was one of the largest that ever throbbed in human bosom;
but his logical faculties were small. When he read the
Calvinistic theory, he was not conversant with the arguments
against it; and hence, with his characteristic impulsiveness, he
adopted a creed, which far more powerful minds than his had
not been able to defend. Southey remarks, with great truthfulness,
that, “at the commencement of his career, Wesley
was of a pugnacious spirit, the effect of his sincerity, his ardour,
and his confidence.” No wonder then that these two devoted
friends were soon at variance.</p>

<p>One of Whitefield’s letters, dated June 25, 1739, has been
already given. The following is another, hitherto unpublished,
written a week later:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <i>July 2, 1739</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,—I confess my spirit has been of late sharpened on
account of some of your proceedings; my heart has been quite broken
within me. I have been grieved from my soul, knowing what a dilemma
I am reduced to. How shall I tell the Dissenters I do not approve of
their doctrines, without wronging my own soul? How shall I tell them I
do, without contradicting my honoured friend, whom I desire to love as
my own soul? Lord, for Thy infinite mercy’s sake, direct me so to act, as
neither to injure myself nor my friend! Is it true, honoured sir, that
brother Stock is excluded the society because he holds predestination?
If so, is it right? Would Jesus Christ have done so? Is this to act
with a catholic spirit? Is it true, honoured sir, that the house at Kingswood
is intended hereafter for the brethren to dwell in, as at Herrnhuth?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
Is this answering the primitive design of that building? Did the Moravians
live together till they were obliged by persecution? Does the
scheme at Islington succeed? As for brother Cennick’s expounding, I
know not what to say. Brother Watkin I think no way qualified for
any such thing.</p>

<p>“Dear, honoured sir, if you have any regard for the peace of the church,
keep in your sermon on predestination. But you have cast a lot. Oh!
my heart, in the midst of my body, is like melted wax. The Lord direct
us all! Honoured sir, indeed, I desire you all the success you can wish
for. May you increase, though I decrease! I would willingly wash your
feet. God is with us mightily. I have just now written to the bishop.
Oh, wrestle, wrestle, honoured sir, in prayer, that not the least alienation
of affection may be between you, honoured sir, and your obedient son and
servant in Christ,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.<br />
<br />
“To the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Mrs. Grevil’s,<br />
a grocer, in Wine Street, Bristol.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This was within three months from the time when Wesley,
at Whitefield’s request, began his career of out-door preaching
at Bristol. Two months later, Whitefield was, a second time,
on his way to America. Wesley wrote to him, opposing the
doctrine of election, and also enforcing the doctrine, that,
though Christians can never be freed from “those numberless
weaknesses and follies, sometimes improperly termed sins of
infirmity,” yet it is the privilege of all to be saved “entirely
from sin in its proper sense, and from committing it.”<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>In reply, Whitefield wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <i>March 26, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My honoured Friend and Brother</span>,—For once hearken to a child,
who is willing to wash your feet. I beseech you, by the mercies of God
in Christ Jesus our Lord, if you would have my love confirmed towards
you, write no more to me about misrepresentations wherein we differ. To
the best of my knowledge, at present, no sin has <i>dominion</i> over me; yet
I feel the strugglings of indwelling sin day by day. I can, therefore, by
no means, come into your interpretation of the passage mentioned in your
letter, and as explained in your preface to Mr. Halyburton. If possible,
I am ten thousand times more convinced of the doctrine of <i>election</i>, and
the <i>final</i> perseverance of those that are truly in Christ, than when I saw
you last. You think otherwise. Why then should we dispute, when
there is no probability of convincing? Will it not, in the end, destroy
brotherly love, and insensibly take from us that cordial union and sweetness
of soul, which I pray God may always subsist between us? How
glad would the enemies of the Lord be to see us divided! How many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
would rejoice, should I join and make a party against you! How would
the cause of our common Master suffer by our raising disputes about
particular points of doctrines! <i>Honoured sir</i>, let us offer salvation freely
to all by the blood of Jesus; and whatever light God has communicated
to us, let us freely communicate to others. I have lately read the life of
Luther, and think it in nowise to his honour, that the last part of his life
was so much taken up in disputing with Zuinglius and others, who, in all
probability, equally loved the Lord Jesus, notwithstanding they might
differ from him in other points. Let this, dear sir, be a caution to us. I
hope it will to me; for, provoke me to it as much as you please, I intend
not to enter the lists of controversy with you on the points wherein we
differ. Only, I pray to God, that the more you <i>judge me</i>, the more I may
<i>love you</i>, and learn to desire no one’s approbation, but that of my Lord
and Master Jesus Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Two months after this, Whitefield wrote again:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Cape Lopen</span>, <i>May 24, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,—I cannot entertain prejudices against your conduct
and principles any longer, without informing you. The more I examine
the writings of the most experienced men, and the experiences of the most
established Christians, the more I differ from your notion about not committing
sin, and your denying the doctrines of election and final perseverance
of the saints. I dread coming to England, unless you are resolved
to oppose these truths with less warmth than when I was there last. I
dread your coming over to America, because the work of God is carried
on here (and that in a most glorious manner), by doctrines quite opposite
to those you hold. Here are thousands of God’s children, who will not
be persuaded out of the privileges purchased for them by the blood of
Jesus. There are many worthy experienced ministers, who would oppose
your principles to the utmost. God direct me what to do! Sometimes,
I think it best to stay here, where we all think and speak the same thing.
The work goes on without divisions, and with more success, because all
employed in it are of one mind. I write not this, honoured sir, from heat
of spirit, but out of love. At present, I think you are entirely inconsistent
with yourself, and, therefore, do not blame me, if I do not approve all
you say. God Himself teaches my friends the doctrine of election.
Sister H—— hath lately been convinced of it; and, if I mistake not, dear
and honoured Mr. Wesley hereafter will be convinced also. Perhaps I
may never see you again, till we meet in judgment; then, if not
before, you will know, that sovereign, distinguishing, irresistible grace
brought you to heaven. Then will you know, that God loved you with an
everlasting love; and therefore with lovingkindness did He draw you.
Honoured sir, farewell!”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>
</div>

<p>A fortnight later, on the 7th of June, Whitefield, writing to
James Hutton, says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For Christ’s sake, desire dear brother Wesley to avoid disputing with
me. I think I had rather die, than see a division between us; and yet
how can we walk together, if we oppose each other?”<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He wrote again to Wesley as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <i>June 25, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My honoured Friend and Brother</span>,—For Christ’s sake, if
possible, never speak against election in your sermons. No one can say,
that I ever mentioned it in public discourses, whatever my private sentiments
may be. For Christ’s sake, let us not be divided amongst ourselves.
Nothing will so much prevent a division as your being silent on
this head. I am glad to hear, that you speak up for an attendance on
the means of grace, and do not encourage persons who run, I am persuaded,
before they are called. The work of God will suffer by such
imprudence.”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the 16th of July, Howel Harris wrote to Wesley:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother John</span>,—Reports are circulated that you hold <i>no
faith</i> without a full and constant assurance, and, that there is no state of
salvation without being wholly set at liberty in the fullest sense of perfection.
It is also said, that I am carried away by the same stream, and,
that many of the little ones are afraid to come near me. Letters have
likewise informed me, that, the night you left London, you turned a
brother out of the society, and charged all to beware of him, purely
because he held the doctrine of election. My dear brother, do not act in
the stiff, uncharitable spirit which you condemn in others. If you exclude
him from the society and from the fraternity of the Methodists, for such a
cause, you must exclude brother Whitefield, brother Seward, and myself.
I hope I shall contend with my last breath and blood, that it is owing to
special, distinguishing, and irresistible grace, that those that are saved
are saved. O that you would not touch on this subject till God enlighten
you! My dear brother, being a public person, you grieve God’s people
by your opposition to electing love; and many poor souls believe your
doctrine simply because you hold it. All this arises from the prejudices
of your education, your books, your companions, and the remains of your
carnal reason. The more I write, the more I love you. I am sure you
are one of God’s elect, and, that you act honestly according to the light
you have.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the 9th of August, Wesley addressed Whitefield as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—I thank you for yours of May the 24th. The
case is quite plain. There are bigots both for predestination and against
it. God is sending a message to those on either side. But neither will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
receive it, unless from one who is of their own opinion. Therefore, for a
time, you are suffered to be of one opinion, and I of another. But when
His time is come, God will do what man cannot, namely, make us both
of one mind. Then persecution will flame out, and it will be seen whether
we count our lives dear unto ourselves, so that we may finish our course
with joy. I am, my dearest brother, ever yours,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In the same month, Whitefield wrote to Wesley:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Charlestown</span>, <i>August 25, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear and honoured Sir</span>,—Give me leave, with all humility, to
exhort you not to be strenuous in opposing the doctrines of election and
final perseverance; when, by your own confession, you have not the
witness of the Spirit within yourself, and consequently are not a proper
judge. I remember brother E—— told me one day, that he was convinced
of the perseverance of saints. I told him, you were not. He
replied, but ‘he will be convinced when he has got the Spirit himself.’
Perhaps the doctrines of election and of final perseverance have been
abused; but, notwithstanding, they are children’s bread, and ought not to
be withheld from them, supposing they are always mentioned with proper
cautions against the abuse of them. I write not this to enter into disputation.
I cannot bear the thought of opposing you; but how can I avoid
it, if you go about, as your brother Charles once said, to drive John Calvin
out of Bristol. Alas! I never read anything that Calvin wrote. My
doctrines I had from Christ and His apostles. I was taught them of God;
and as God was pleased to send me out first, and to enlighten me first, so,
I think, He still continues to do it. I find, there is a disputing among you
about election and perfection. I pray God to put a stop to it; for what
good end will it answer? I wish I knew your principles fully. If you
were to write oftener, and more frankly, it might have a better effect than
silence and reserve.”<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>
</div>

<p>A month later he wrote again as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>September 25, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,—I am sorry to hear, by many letters, that you seem
to own a <i>sinless perfection</i> in this life attainable. I think I cannot answer
you better, than a venerable minister in these parts answered a Quaker:
‘Bring me a man that hath really arrived to this, and I will pay his expenses,
let him come from where he will.’ I know not what you may think,
but I do not expect to say indwelling sin is destroyed in me, till I bow my
head and give up the ghost. There must be some Amalekites left in the
Israelites’ land to keep his soul in action, to keep him humble, and to
drive him continually to Jesus Christ for pardon. I know many abuse this
doctrine, and perhaps wilfully indulge sin, or do not aspire after holiness,
because no man is perfect in this life. But what of that? Must I assert,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
therefore, doctrines contrary to the gospel? God forbid! Besides, dear
sir, what a fond conceit is it to cry up <i>perfection</i>, and yet cry down the
doctrine of <i>final perseverance</i>. But this, and many other absurdities, you
will run into, because you will not own <i>election</i>. And you will not own
<i>election</i>, because you cannot own it without believing the doctrine of
<i>reprobation</i>. What then is there in <i>reprobation</i> so horrid? I see no
blasphemy in holding that doctrine, if rightly explained. If God might
have passed by all, He may pass by some. Judge whether it is not a
greater blasphemy to say, ‘Christ died for souls now in hell.’ Surely, dear
sir, you do not believe there will be a general gaol <i>delivery</i> of damned
souls hereafter. O that you would study the covenant of grace! But I
have done. If you think so meanly of Bunyan and the puritan writers, I
do not wonder that you think me wrong. I find your sermon has had its
expected success. It has set the nation a disputing. You will have
enough to do now to answer pamphlets. Two I have already seen. O
that you would be more cautious in casting lots! O that you would not
be too rash and precipitant! If you go on thus, honoured sir, how can I
concur with you? It is impossible. I must speak what I know. About
spring you may expect to see,</p>

<p>Wesley’s sermon was already published. Let us look at it.
It was preached at Bristol; and, in some respects, was the
most important sermon that he ever issued. It led, as we
shall shortly see, to the division which Whitefield so devoutly
deprecates; and also to the organisation of Lady Huntingdon’s
Connexion, and to the founding of the Calvinistic
Methodists in Wales; and, finally, culminated in the fierce
controversy of 1770, and the publication of Fletcher’s
unequalled “Checks;” which so effectually silenced the
Calvinian heresy, that its voice has scarce been heard from
that time to this. Viewed in such a light, the difference
between Wesley and Whitefield was really one of the greatest
events in the history of Wesley and even of the religion of
the age.</p>

<p>Wesley’s sermon, entitled “Free Grace,” was founded upon
Romans viii. 32, and was printed as a 12mo pamphlet in
twenty-four pages. Annexed to it was Charles Wesley’s
remarkable “Hymn on Universal Redemption,” consisting of
thirty-six stanzas of four lines each.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> It is also a noteworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
fact, that, notwithstanding its importance, it was never included
by Wesley in any collected edition of his sermons;
and, in his own edition of his works, it is placed among his
controversial writings. There is likewise a brief address to
the reader, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nothing but the strongest conviction, not only that what is here
advanced is ‘the truth as it is in Jesus,’ but also that I am indispensably
obliged to declare this truth to all the world, could have induced me
openly to oppose the sentiments of those whom I esteem for their works’ sake;
at whose feet may I be found in the day of the Lord Jesus!</p>

<p>“Should any believe it his duty to reply hereto, I have only one request
to make,—let whatsoever you do be done in charity, in love, and in
the spirit of meekness. Let your very disputing show, that you have
‘put on, as the elect of God, bowels of mercies, gentleness, longsuffering,’
that even according to this time it may be said, ‘See how these Christians
love one another.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Having laid down the principle that God’s “free grace is
free in all, and free for all,” Wesley proceeds, with great acuteness,
to define the doctrine of predestination; namely, “Free
grace in all is not free for all, but only for those whom God
hath ordained to life. The greater part of mankind God
hath ordained to death; and it is not free for them. Them
God hateth; and therefore, before they were born, decreed
they should die eternally. And this He absolutely decreed,
because it was His sovereign will. Accordingly, they are born
for this, to be destroyed body and soul in hell. And they
grow up under the irrevocable curse of God, without any
possibility of redemption; for what grace God gives, He gives
only for this, to increase, not prevent, their damnation.”</p>

<p>Having effectually answered the objections of well meaning
people, who, startled at a doctrine so spectral, say, “This is
not the predestination which I hold, I hold only the election
of grace,” he sums up as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though you use softer words than some, you mean the selfsame
thing; and God’s decree concerning the election of grace, according to
your account of it, amounts to neither more nor less than what others
call, ‘God’s decree of reprobation.’ Call it therefore by whatever name
you please, ‘election, preterition, predestination, or reprobation,’ it comes
in the end to the same thing. The sense of all is plainly this,—by virtue
of an eternal, unchangeable, irresistible decree of God, one part of mankind
are infallibly saved, and the rest infallibly damned; it being impos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>sible
that any of the former should be damned, or that any of the latter
should be saved.”</p>
</div>

<p>This presents the doctrine in all its naked, hideous
deformity; but it is fair, and no Calvinian dexterity can
make it otherwise.</p>

<p>Wesley then proceeds to state the objections to such
a doctrine:—</p>

<p>1. It renders all preaching vain; for preaching is needless
to them that are elected; for they, whether with it or without
it, will infallibly be saved. And it is useless to them that are
not elected; for they, whether with preaching or without,
will infallibly be damned.</p>

<p>2. It directly tends to destroy that holiness which is the
end of all the ordinances of God; for it wholly takes away
those first motives to follow after holiness, so frequently proposed
in Scripture, the hope of future reward and fear of
punishment, the hope of heaven and fear of hell.</p>

<p>3. It directly tends to destroy several particular branches
of holiness; for it naturally tends to inspire, or increase, a
sharpness of temper, which is quite contrary to the meekness
of Christ, and leads a man to treat with contempt, or coldness,
those whom he supposes to be outcasts from God.</p>

<p>4. It tends to destroy the comfort of religion.</p>

<p>5. It directly tends to destroy our zeal for good works; for
what avails it to relieve the wants of those who are just dropping
into eternal fire!</p>

<p>6. It has a direct and manifest tendency to overthrow the
whole Christian revelation; for it makes it unnecessary.</p>

<p>7. It makes the Christian revelation contradict itself; for
it is grounded on such an interpretation of some texts as
flatly contradicts all the other texts, and indeed the whole
scope and tenour of Scripture.</p>

<p>8. It is full of blasphemy; for it represents our blessed
Lord as a hypocrite and dissembler, in saying one thing and
meaning another,—in pretending a love which He had not; it
also represents the most holy God as more false, more cruel,
and more unjust than the devil; for, in point of fact, it says
that God has condemned millions of souls to everlasting fire
for continuing in sin, which, for want of the grace He gives
them not, they are unable to avoid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>Wesley sums up the whole thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is the blasphemy clearly contained in <i>the horrible decree</i> of predestination.
And here I fix my foot. On this I join issue with every
asserter of it. You represent God as worse than the devil. But you say,
you will prove it by Scripture. Hold! what will you prove by Scripture?
that God is worse than the devil? It cannot be. Whatever that Scripture
proves, it never can prove this; whatever its true meaning be, this
cannot be its true meaning. Do you ask, ‘What is its true meaning
then?’ If I say, ‘I know not,’ you have gained nothing; for there are
many scriptures, the true sense whereof neither you nor I shall know till
death is swallowed up in victory. But this I know, better it were to say
it had no sense at all, than to say it had such a sense as this.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Whitefield’s letter, already given, and dated September
25, 1740, he states that already he had seen two pamphlets
published against Wesley’s sermon. One of these probably
was the following: “Free Grace Indeed! A Letter to the
Reverend Mr. John Wesley, relating to his sermon against
absolute election, published under the title of Free Grace.
London: 1740. Price sixpence.”</p>

<p>In a subsequent advertisement, Wesley writes, “Whereas
a pamphlet, entitled, ‘Free Grace Indeed!’ has been published
against this sermon, this is to inform the publisher that I
cannot answer his tract till he appears to be more in earnest;
for I dare not speak of ‘the deep things of God’ in the spirit
of a prizefighter or a stageplayer.”</p>

<p>With great respect for Wesley, we feel bound to say, that
this is not worthy of him. The pamphlet referred to is before
us, and is written with great ability, earnestness, and good
temper. Wesley was not bound to answer it; but he had
no right thus to brand it.</p>

<p>About the same time, another pamphlet was published,
on the other side, entitled, “The Controversy concerning
Free-will and Predestination; in a Letter to a Friend.
Recommended to Mr. Whitefield and his followers.” 8vo,
pages 36. As the controversy continued, it waxed
warmer. Here Whitefield is spoken of as a man of
“heated imagination, and full of himself”; “very hot,
very self-sufficient, and impatient of contradiction”; “dogmatical
and dictatorial” in his way of speaking, and wont
to finish his oracular deliverances “with his assuming
air, <i>Dixi</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>The pamphlet concludes with a verse which contains the
pith of the whole production:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why is this <i>wrangling world</i> thus <i>tossed</i> and <i>torn</i>?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Free-grace</i>, Free-will, are both together born;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If God’s free grace rule <i>in</i>, and <i>over</i> me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His will is mine, and so my will is <i>free</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the month of October, Howel Harris took up the question,
and wrote to Wesley, telling him that preaching electing
love brings glory to God, and benefit and consolation to the
soul. He adds: “Oh, when will the time come when we shall
all agree? Till then, may the Lord enable us to bear with
one another! We must, before we can be united, be truly
simple, made really humble and open to conviction, willing
to give up any expression that is not scriptural, dead to our
names and characters, and sweetly inclined towards each
other. I hope we have, in some measure, drank of the same
Spirit, that we fight the same enemies, and are under the
same crown and kingdom. We travel the same narrow road,
and love the same Jesus. We are soon to be before the same
throne, and employed in the same work of praise to all eternity.
While, then, we are on the road, and meet with so many
enemies, let us love one another. And if we really carry on
the same cause, let us not weaken each other’s hands.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>In another letter, addressed to John Cennick, and dated
October 27, Harris writes in less temperate language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,—Brother Seward tells me of his dividing with
brother Charles Wesley. He seems clear in his conviction, that God
would have him do so. I have been long waiting to see if brother John
and Charles should receive further light, or be silent and not oppose
election and perseverance; but, finding no hope of this, I begin to be
staggered how to act towards them. I plainly see that we preach two
gospels. My dear brother, deal faithfully with brother John and
Charles. If you like, you may read this letter to them. We are free in
Wales from the hellish infection; but some are tainted when they come
to Bristol.”<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In November, Whitefield wrote to Wesley as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, <i>November 9, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear and honoured Sir</span>,—I received yours, dated March 11,
this afternoon. Oh that we were of one mind! for I am persuaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
you greatly err. You have set a mark you will never arrive at, till you
come to glory. O dear sir, many of God’s children are grieved at your
principles. Oh that God may give you a sight of His free, sovereign, and
electing love! But no more of this. Why will you compel me to write
thus? Why will you dispute? I am willing to go with you to prison,
and to death; but I am not willing to oppose you. Dear, dear sir, study
the covenant of grace, that you may be consistent with yourself. Oh
build up, but do not lead into error, the souls once committed to the
charge of your affectionate, unworthy brother and servant, in the loving
Jesus,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">G. Whitefield</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A fortnight later he wrote again to Wesley:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Bohemia, Maryland</span>, <i>November 24, 1740</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear and honoured Sir</span>,—Last night brother G—— brought me
your two kind letters. Oh that there may be harmony, and very intimate
union between us! Yet, it cannot be, since you hold <i>universal redemption</i>.
The devil rages in London. He begins now to triumph indeed.
The children of God are disunited among themselves. My dear brother,
for Christ’s sake, avoid all disputation. Do not oblige me to preach
against you; I had rather die. Be gentle towards the——. They
will get great advantage over you, if they discover any irregular warmth
in your temper. I cannot for my soul unite with the <i>Moravian Brethren</i>.
Honoured sir, adieu!</p>

<p class="psig">
“Yours eternally in Christ Jesus,<br />
“<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Just at this time, Wesley was expounding Romans ix. at
Bristol, where Calvinism was becoming rampant in the society.
Charles Wesley writes: “Anne Ayling and Anne Davis could
not refrain from railing. John Cennick never offered to stop
them. Alas, we have set the wolf to keep the sheep! God
gave me great moderation toward him, who, for many months,
has been undermining our doctrine and authority.”<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The difference was continued by Whitefield writing his
“Letter to the Reverend Mr. John Wesley; in answer to
his sermon, entitled ‘Free Grace’;” with the motto attached,
“When Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
face, because he was to be blamed.”</p>

<p>The “Letter” is dated, “Bethesda, in Georgia, December
24, 1740.” After reiterating his reluctance to write against
Wesley, he proceeds to state, that he now did so at the re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>quest
of a great number of persons, who had been benefited
by his ministry. He accuses Wesley of having propagated
the doctrine of universal redemption, both in public and
private, by preaching and printing, ever since before his last
departure for America. He says that Wesley, while at
Bristol, received a letter, charging him with not preaching
the gospel, because he did not preach election. Upon this,
he drew a lot; the answer was, “<i>preach and print</i>;” and,
accordingly, he preached and printed against election. At
Whitefield’s desire, he deferred publishing the sermon until
after Whitefield started for America, when he sent it out.
Whitefield asserts, that, if any one wished to prove the doctrine
of election and of final perseverance, he could hardly
wish for a text more fit for his purpose than that (Romans
viii. 32) which Wesley had chosen to disprove it. He charges
him with giving an “equivocal definition of the word <i>grace</i>,”
and a “false definition of the word <i>free</i>;” and adds: “I
frankly acknowledge, I believe the doctrine of reprobation,
in this view, that God intends to give saving grace, through
Jesus Christ, only to a certain number; and that the rest of
mankind, after the fall of Adam, being justly left of God to
continue in sin, will at last suffer that eternal death, which
is its proper wages.” In reply to Wesley, he argues that,
because preachers know not who are elect, and who reprobate,
they are bound to preach promiscuously to all; that holiness
is made a mark of election by all who preach it; that the
seventeenth article of the English Church asserts, that the
doctrine of “predestination and election in Christ is full of
unspeakable comfort to godly persons;” that dooming millions
to everlasting burnings is not an act of injustice, because
God, for the sin of Adam, might justly have thus doomed
all; that God’s absolute purpose of saving His chosen does
not preclude the necessity of the gospel revelation, or the
use of any of the means through which He has determined
the decree shall take effect; that the doctrine of election does
not make the Bible contradict itself, for though it asserts,
that “the Lord is loving to every man, and His mercy is
over all His works,” the reference is to His <i>general</i>, not His
<i>saving</i> mercy; that it is unjust to charge the doctrine of
reprobation with blasphemy; and that, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
the doctrine of universal redemption, as set forth by Wesley,
“is really the highest reproach upon the dignity of the Son
of God, and the merit of His blood;” and Whitefield challenges
Wesley to make good the assertion, “that Christ died
for them that perish,” without holding, as Peter Bohler had
lately confessed in a letter, “that all the damned souls would
hereafter be brought out of hell;” for “how can all be universally
redeemed, if all are not finally saved?”</p>

<p>In conclusion, he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Dear sir, for Jesus Christ’s sake, consider how you dishonour
God by denying election. You plainly make man’s salvation depend not
on God’s <i>free grace</i>, but on man’s <i>free will</i>. Dear, dear sir, give yourself
to reading. Study the covenant of grace. Down with your carnal
reasoning. Be a little child; and then, instead of pawning your salvation,
as you have done in a late hymn-book, if the doctrine of <i>universal
redemption</i> be not true; instead of talking of <i>sinless perfection</i>, as you
have done in the preface to that hymn-book; and instead of making
man’s salvation to depend on his own <i>free will</i>, as you have in this
sermon, you will compose a hymn in praise of sovereign, distinguishing
love; you will caution believers against striving to work a perfection out
of their own hearts, and will print another sermon the reverse of this, and
entitle it ‘Free Grace <i>Indeed</i>’—free, because not free to all; but free,
because God may withhold or give it to whom and when He pleases.”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>
</div>

<p>About three weeks after the date of this letter, Whitefield
set sail for England, bringing his manuscript with him. On
his arrival in London, in March, 1741, he submitted it to
Charles Wesley, who returned it to the author, endorsed
with the words: “Put up again thy sword into its place.”
The pamphlet, however, was published; and Whitefield gave
Wesley notice, that he was resolved publicly to preach against
him and his brother wherever he went. Wesley complained
to Whitefield—1. That it was imprudent to publish his letter,
because it was only putting weapons into the hands of those
who hated them. 2. That, if he really was constrained to
bear his testimony on the subject, he might have done it
by issuing a treatise without ever calling Wesley’s name
in question. 3. That what he had published was a mere
burlesque upon an answer. 4. That he had said enough,
however, of what was wholly foreign to the question, to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
an open, and probably irreparable, breach between them.
Wesley added:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You rank all the maintainers of <i>universal redemption</i> with Socinians.
Alas, my brother! Do you not know even this, that Socinians allow
no redemption at all? that Socinus himself speaks thus, ‘<i>Tota
redemptio nostra per Christum metaphora</i>’? How easy were it for me
to hit many other palpable blots, in what you call an answer to my
sermon! And how, above measure, contemptible would you then appear
to all impartial men, either of sense or learning! But, I assure you,
my hand shall not be upon you. The Lord be judge between me and
thee! The general tenour, both of my public and private exhortations,
when I touch thereon at all, as even my enemies know, if they would
testify, is ‘Spare the young man, even Absalom, for my sake!’”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>
</div>

<p>David and Jonathan were divided. An immediate schism
followed. Wesley writes:—“In March, 1741, Mr. Whitefield,
being returned to England, entirely separated from Mr. Wesley
and his friends, because he did not hold the decrees. Here
was the first breach, which warm men persuaded Mr. Whitefield
to make merely for a difference of opinion. Those who
believed universal redemption had no desire to separate; but
those who held particular redemption would not hear of any
accommodation, being determined to have no fellowship with
men that were ‘in such dangerous errors.’ So there were
now two sorts of Methodists: those for particular, and those
for general, redemption.”<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Here, for the present, we leave the subject; and turn to
other matters.</p>

<p>In 1740, as in 1739, the pamphlets published against
Methodism were many and malignant. One was entitled:
“The important Doctrines of Original Sin, Justification by
Faith, and Regeneration, clearly stated and vindicated from the
misrepresentations of the Methodists. By Thomas Whiston,
A.B.” London: 1740. Pp. 70. Mr. Whiston is unknown
to fame. Wesley never noticed him; and, though his production
is now before us, an analysis of its contents would
weary the reader without instructing him.</p>

<p>Another was, “The Quakers and Methodists compared.
By the Rev. Zachary Grey, LL.D., Rector of Houghton
Conquest, in Bedfordshire,”—the laborious author of more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
than thirty different publications, a man of great ingenuity
and research, but an acrimonious polemic, who died at
Ampthill, in 1766.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that Whitefield was far more violently
attacked than the Wesleys were. “Aquila Smyth, a layman
of the Church of England,” accuses him of having published
two letters against Archbishop Tillotson, “in the spirit of
pride, envy, and malice;” and of having “detracted the most
valuable works of other men, in order to aggrandize himself,
and gain credit for his own weak, impudent, and wicked
performances.” His “behaviour exposes him to the scorn of
every reader;” and his “consummate impudence” is unequalled
in the Christian world. There “is a juggle between
him and Wesley to deceive their followers, and to prevent
an inquiry into their corrupt and abominable doctrine;” and,
finally, after calling him “a brainsick enthusiast,” Smyth
declares, that Whitefield has taken up five thousand acres in
America, under the pretence of educating and maintaining
such negroes as may be sent to him; but really because he
hopes to realise from the transaction a more plentiful fortune
than he could have gained in England by five thousand years
of preaching.</p>

<p>So much for the spleen of Aquila Smyth. In the <i>Weekly
Miscellany</i>, edited by Mr. Hooker, there appeared, in several
successive numbers, fictitious dialogues between Whitefield
and a country clergyman, the object of which was to make
Whitefield contemptible; and the whole were finished with a
promise from the editor, that he would abridge, for the benefit
of his subscribers, the history of the Anabaptists, and would
show that there is a near resemblance between them and
their descendants, the Methodists.</p>

<p>The Rev. Alexander Garden, the Bishop of London’s commissary
at Charlestown, in America, published a series of
six letters on justification by faith and works, in which he
accused Whitefield of “self contradiction,” of “arrogant and
wicked slander,” and of being “so full of zeal that he had no
room for charity.” He contemptuously speaks of Whitefield’s
“apparent shuffles,” “miserable distinctions,” “mob harangues,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
and “false and poisoned insinuations.” Whitefield “deceives
the people, and has no talent at proving anything”; he is “a
hare-brained solifidian, and runs about a mouthing”; he
has “kindled a fire of slander and defamation, which no devil
in hell, nor jesuit on earth, will ever make an effort to extinguish,
but will fagot and foment it with all their might”;
“he dispenses to the populace in a vehicle of cant terms,
without sense or meaning”; and “in a mountebank way, he
fancies himself a young David, and that he has slain Goliath.”</p>

<p>Whitefield was again severely handled “by a presbyter of
the Church of England,” in an able pamphlet of forty-four
pages, entitled “A modest and serious Defence of the Author
of the Whole Duty of Man, from the false charges and gross
misrepresentations of Mr. Whitefield, and the Methodists his
adherents”; but this was a castigation which Whitefield
merited, for his ill judged and unneeded letter, published in
the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of July 3, 1740.</p>

<p>The most violent attack of all was in an octavo pamphlet
of eighty-five pages, with the title, “The Expounder Expounded,
by R——ph J——ps——n, of the Inner Temple,
Esq.” London. Some parts of this disgraceful production
are too filthy to be noticed; they must be passed in silence.
In other parts, Whitefield, for publishing his journal, is
charged with “saddling the world with one of the grossest
absurdities and impositions, that folly or impudence could
invent”; “his book is nothing but a continued account of
his intimate union and correspondence with the devil”; and
he himself may be seen “upon the hills and house-tops, like
another Æolus, belching out his divine vapours to the
multitude, to the great ease of himself, and emolument of
his auditors.” “Charles Wesley lent him books at Oxford,
which threw his understanding off the hinges, and rendered
him <i>enthusiastically</i> crazy”; at college he “deemed a lousy
pate <i>humility</i>, foul linen was <i>heavenly contemplation</i>, woollen
gloves were <i>grace</i>, a patched gown was <i>justification by faith</i>,
and dirty shoes meant a <i>walk with God</i>. In short, with him,
religion consisted wholly in <i>nastiness</i>, and heaven was
easiest attacked from a <i>dunghill</i>.” These are the mildest
specimens we have been able to select from this cesspool of a
perverted intellect and a polluted heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>Another pamphlet, published in 1740, and consisting of
eighty-four pages, was entitled “The Imposture of Methodism
displayed; in a letter to the inhabitants of the parish of
Dewsbury. Occasioned by the rise of a certain modern sect
of enthusiasts, called Methodists. By William Bowman, M. A.,
vicar of Dewsbury and Aldbrough in Yorkshire, and chaplain
to the Right Honourable Charles, Earl of Hoptoun.” As
yet, neither the Wesleys nor Whitefield had been in Yorkshire;
but Ingham and William Delamotte were there, and had
been the means of converting a large number of the almost
heathenised inhabitants of the west riding. The reverend
vicar tells his parishioners, that “an impious spirit of enthusiasm
and superstition has crept in among them, and threatens
a total ruin of all religion and virtue.” He himself has been
“an eye-witness of this monstrous madness, and religious
frenzy, which, like a rapid torrent, bears down everything
beautiful before it, and introduces nothing but a confused and
ridiculous medley of nonsense and inconsistency.” It was
matter of thankfulness, “that the contagion, at present, was
pretty much confined to the dregs and refuse of the people,—the
weak, unsteady mob, always fond of innovation, and
never pleased but with variety;” but, then, the mob was so
numerous in the west of Yorkshire, that the danger was
greater than was apprehended. The author declines to determine
whether “these modern visionaries, like the Quakers,
are a sect hatched and fashioned in a seminary of Jesuits;
or whether, like the German Anabaptists, they are a set of
crazy, distempered fanatics;” but certain it is, that their
“enthusiasm is patched and made up of a thousand incoherencies
and absurdities, picked and collected from the
vilest errors and most pestilent follies, of every heresy upon
earth.” “Their teachers inculcate, that they are Divinely
and supernaturally inspired by the Holy Ghost, to declare
the will of God to mankind; and, yet, they are cheats and
impostors, and their pretended sanctity nothing but a trick
and a delusion.” They had been allowed to use the pulpits
of the Church, “till, by their flights and buffooneries, they had
made the church more like a bear-garden than the house of
prayer; and the rostrum nothing else but the trumpet of sedition,
heresy, blasphemy, and everything destructive to religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
and good manners.” It was high time for the clergy to put
an end to their “pulpits being let out, as a stage, for mountebanks
and jack-puddings to play their tricks upon, and from
thence to propagate their impostures and delusions.” “These
mad devotionalists held, that it is lawful and expedient for
mere laymen, for women, and the meanest and most ignorant
mechanics, to minister in the church of Christ, to preach, and
expound the word of God, and to offer up the prayers of the
congregation in the public assemblies.” They also taught, that
“the new birth consists in an absolute and entire freedom
from all kind of sin whatsoever;” and likewise “denounced
eternal death and damnation on all who cannot conform to
their ridiculous ideas.” “Whilst adopting to themselves the
reputation of being the chief favourites of heaven, the confidants
and imparters of its secrets, and the dispensers of its
frowns and favours, they were really furious disciples of antichrist,
reverend scavengers of scandal, and filthy pests and
plagues of mankind.” Such are specimens of the meek language
used by the reverend vicar of Dewsbury.</p>

<p>We have already noticed one production of the fiery and
furious Joseph Trapp, D.D., published in 1739. The publication
of that produced others, in 1740. One was entitled,
“The true Spirit of the Methodists, and their Allies, fully laid
open; in an answer to six of the seven pamphlets, lately
published against Dr. Trapp’s sermons upon being ‘Righteous
over much’”: pp. 98. The anonymous author says, that one
of these six pamphlets is full of “false quotations, lies, and
slanders,” and concludes with “an ungodly jumble of railing
and praying.” The Methodists are branded as “crack-brained
enthusiasts and profane hypocrites.” “The criterions of
modern saintship are the most unchristian malice, lying,
slander, railing, and cursing.” Whitefield is pronounced “impious
and ignorant.” The “false doctrines and blasphemies
of the Methodists, their field assemblies and conventicles in
houses, are contrary to the laws of God and man, of church
and state, and are tending to the ruin of both.”</p>

<p>Another pamphlet, of 127 pages, was by Dr. Trapp himself,
and entitled, “A Reply to Mr. Law’s earnest and serious
Answer (as it is called) to Dr. Trapp’s discourse on being
righteous over much.” The reverend doctor, as inflam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>mable
as ever, pronounces the Methodists “a new sect of
enthusiasts, or hypocrites, or both; whose doctrines and practices
tend to the destruction of souls, are a scandal to
Christianity, and expose it to the scoffs of libertines, infidels,
and atheists.” This is not an unfair specimen of the whole
127 pages. William Law, however, was far too stout an
antagonist to be silenced by Dr. Trapp. His “Serious Answer”
to Trapp’s sermons, and his “Animadversions” on
Trapp’s reply, whilst written in the highest style of Christian
courtesy, are witheringly severe. They may be found in
Wesley’s collected publications, edit. 1772, vol. vi.</p>

<p>Another doughty anti-Methodistic champion was the celebrated
Dr. Daniel Waterland, chaplain in ordinary to his
majesty, canon of Windsor, archdeacon of Middlesex, and
vicar of Twickenham; one of the greatest controversialists of
the age, who died at the end of the year of which we are
writing, and whose collected works have since been published
in eleven octavo volumes.</p>

<p>A few months before his death, Waterland preached two
sermons, first at Twickenham, and next at Windsor, on
regeneration, which, without mentioning the Methodists,
were undeniably meant to serve as an antidote to the doctrines
they preached. These he published in the form of
an octavo pamphlet of fifty-six pages, accompanied by a
mass of notes in Latin, Greek, and English, from all sorts
of authors. The title of the pamphlet is, “Regeneration
Stated and Explained, according to Scripture and Antiquity,
in a Discourse on Titus iii. 4, 5, 6;” and its subject may be
inferred from the following definition:—“The new birth, in
the general, means a spiritual change, wrought upon any
person by the Holy Spirit, in the use of baptism; whereby
he is translated from his natural state in Adam, to a spiritual
state in Christ.” Written from such a standpoint, the pamphlet
of course was a tacit condemnation of the doctrines of
the Methodists. It is immensely learned, but far from luminous;
full of talent, but likewise full of error; exceedingly
elaborate, but, to an equal extent, bewildering.</p>

<p>We shall mention only one other attack on Methodism and
the Methodists made at this period. This was a pamphlet of
fifty-five pages, with the title, “The Trial of Mr. Whitefield’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
Spirit, in some remarks upon his fourth Journal.” The
author makes himself merry with the discovery, that this
new sect of enthusiasts, by taking to themselves the name of
<i>Methodist</i>, have unintentionally stigmatised themselves with
a designation which is branded in Scripture as evil. “The
word Μεθοδεια, or Methodism, is only used twice throughout
the New Testament (Ephesians iv. 14, and vi. 11), and in
both places denotes that cunning craftiness whereby evil men,
or evil spirits, lie in wait to deceive.” It is alleged that
Wesley, Whitefield, and their followers, “have taken an appellation,
perhaps through a judicial inadvertence, which the
Spirit of God has peculiarly appropriated to the adversary of
mankind, and to those who are leagued with him in enmity
to the interests of righteousness and true holiness.” This
was an ingenious hit; the writer, however, forgetting or misstating
the fact, that the name of Methodists was not self-assumed,
but imposed by others. “Μεθοδευσαι δε εστι το απατησαι—to
 be a Methodist, says St. Chrysostom, is to be
beguiled.” And, from this, the author wishes the inference
to be deduced, that, because the new sect of enthusiasts were
called Methodists, they were all beguiled, and, of course,
Wesley and Whitefield were the great beguilers. The remainder
of the pamphlet is a critique on Whitefield’s Journals,
which, it must be admitted, were unguardedly expressed,
and which, before being printed, ought to have been revised
by a kindred spirit, possessed of a soberer judgment than
Whitefield had.</p>

<p>The Methodist persecutions of 1740 were chiefly of a
literary kind. It is true that Charles Wesley met with a
rough reception at Bengeworth, where Henry Seward called
him “a scoundrel and a rascal”; directed the mob to “take
him away and duck him”; and actually seized him by the
nose and wrung it. This was bad enough, but the treatment
of John Cennick and his friends was even worse. While he was
preaching at Upton, in Gloucestershire, the mob assembled
with a horn, a drum, and a number of brass pans, and made
a most horrid hubbub; the brass pans being also used in
beating the people’s heads. A man likewise put a cat into a
cage, and brought a pack of hounds to make them bark at
it. Another fellow and his wife, who kept an alehouse at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
Hannam, rode through the congregation, thrashing the people
with their whips, and trampling them beneath their horses’ hoofs. Little children collected dust, which their upgrown
patrons cast upon Cennick, who was also struck violently on
the nose, and became a target at which to hurl dead dogs
and stones.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> But even violent and contemptuous treatment
like this was not near so painful as the scurrilous attacks
encountered through the press. In this way, the persecution
of the Methodists was something more than a localised
outburst of spleen and hate; for, in all sorts of squibs,
they were gibbeted, and exposed to ridicule, throughout the
kingdom.</p>

<p>Wesley’s trials were not trifles; but, in the midst of all,
he bravely pursued the path of duty; and, after the final
separation from his foolish, fanatical friends at Fetter Lane,
his labours in London were attended with considerable success.
On August 11, while forty or fifty were praying and
giving thanks at the Foundery, two persons began to cry to
God with a loud and bitter cry, and soon found peace. Five
days after, a woman, at Long Lane, fell down and continued
in violent agonies for an hour. In September, a great number
of men forced their way into the Foundery, and began to
speak big, swelling words; but, “immediately after, the
hammer of the word brake the rocks in pieces.” A smuggler
rushed in and cursed vehemently; but, when Wesley finished
preaching, the man declared, before the congregation, that,
henceforth, he would abandon smuggling and give God his
heart.</p>

<p>Wesley’s efforts to do good were various. In London, he
induced his friends to contribute the clothing they could
spare, and distributed it among the poor of the Foundery
society. In Bristol, besides visiting numbers of people “ill
of the spotted fever,” he took into his Broadmead meeting-house
twelve of the poorest people he could find, who were
out of work; and, to save them at once from want and from
idleness, employed them for four months in carding and
spinning cotton.</p>

<p>Wesley concluded this eventful year at Bristol, by holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
a watchnight meeting, proposed by James Rogers, a Kingswood
collier, noted among his neighbours for his playing on
the violin, but who, being awakened under the ministry of
Charles Wesley, went home, burnt his fiddle, and told his
wife that he meant to be a Methodist. To his death, James
was faithful, and, besides many other important services,
was the first Methodist preacher that preached at Stroud in
Gloucestershire.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>This was the first watchnight meeting among the Methodists.
The people met at half-past eight; the house was
filled from end to end; and “we concluded the year,” says
Wesley, “wrestling with God in prayer, and praising Him
for the wonderful work which He had already wrought upon
the earth.”</p>

<p>The meeting soon became a favourite one, and was held
monthly. Wesley writes: “Some advised me to put an end
to this; but, upon weighing the thing thoroughly, and comparing
it with the practice of the ancient Christians, I could
see no cause to forbid it. Rather, I believed it might be
made of more general use.”<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> ‘The church, in ancient times,
was accustomed to spend whole nights in prayer, which
nights were termed <i>vigiliæ</i>, or vigils; and, sanctioned by such
authority, Wesley appointed monthly watchnights, on the
Fridays nearest the full moon, desiring that they, and they
only, should attend, who could do it without prejudice to
their business or families.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be said concerning 1740. During
the entire year, Wesley preached in only three churches,
namely at Newbury, and at Lanhithel, and Lantarnum, in
Wales. His favourite text was Ephesians ii. 8, showing that
his mind and heart were still full of the glorious truth, salvation
by grace through faith in Christ.</p>

<p>One of his publications has been already noticed. Another
was a third volume of hymns, pp. 209, by no means inferior
to its predecessors in poetic excellence, or Christian character.
The book is also possessed of considerable historic interest,
containing, as it does, a long hymn of twenty-two verses, de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>scriptive
of Charles Wesley’s history up to this period; and
likewise several hymns addressed to Whitefield; and one
“for the Kingswood colliers.” The volume consists of ninety-six
hymns and poems, only four of which are selected from
other authors. The preface is remarkable, giving a description
of the man possessed of a clean heart. He is freed from
pride, self will, evil thoughts, wandering thoughts, doubts,
fears, etc. Wesley, a quarter of a century afterwards, declared
that this preface contains the strongest account that
he ever gave of Christian perfection; and admitted, that
some of the statements needed correction; especially, that
the perfect Christian is so “freed from self will as not to
desire ease in pain;” that, “in prayer, he is so delivered from
wanderings, that he has no thought of anything past, or
absent, or to come, but of God alone,” etc. Wesley never
taught anything respecting Christian perfection, but what
was, either directly or indirectly, contained in this preface;
but some of its strong assertions he wished to modify.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Another publication, issued in 1740, was entitled, “Serious
Considerations concerning the Doctrines of Election and
Reprobation. Extracted from a late author.” 12mo, twelve
pages. It is a condensed, well argued tract on what had
become a bone of contention between Wesley and his friend
Whitefield. The address to the reader is beautiful: “Let us
bear with one another, remembering it is the prerogative of
the great God to pierce through all His own infinite schemes
with an unerring eye, to surround them with an all-comprehensive
view, to grasp them all in one single survey, and to
spread a reconciling light over all their immense varieties.
Man must yet grapple with difficulties in this dusky twilight;
but God, in His time, will irradiate the earth more plentifully
with His light and truth.”</p>

<p>Another of Wesley’s publications was a 12mo tract of
nineteen pages, with the title, “The Nature and Design of
Christianity, extracted from a late author” (Mr. Law); and
another was Wesley’s second Journal, extending from February
1 to August 12, 1738. 12mo, pp. 90.</p>

<p>The year 1740, in Wesley’s history, was not marked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
great religious success; but it was one of the most eventful
years in his chequered life. There was a full and final separation
from the Moravians; there was the separate organisation
of the Methodist society at Moorfields; and there was the
controversy with Whitefield. All these matters will again
demand attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741<br />

Age  38</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH the exception of a week spent in the midland
counties, about a month at Oxford, and three weeks
in Wales, Wesley divided the year 1741, in almost equal
proportions, between London and Bristol.</p>

<p>Whitefield arrived in England, from America, in the month
of March; and, finding his congregations at Moorfields and
Kennington Common dwindled down from twenty thousand
to two or three hundred, he started off to Bristol, where he
remained till the end of May; when he came back to London,
and, on July 25, sailed thence to Scotland, writing six-and-twenty
pastoralizing letters on the way, and arriving at
Leith on July 30. The next three months were spent with
the Erskines and others, the leaders of the Seceders, who,
in the year preceding, had been solemnly expelled by the
General Assembly, and had had their relation to the national
church formally dissolved. Whitefield’s career of out-door
preaching, and his success in Scotland, were marvellous. All
the time, however, he was burdened with an enormous debt,
incurred on account of his orphan house in Georgia, and
was sometimes threatened with arrest. On leaving Scotland,
he proceeded direct to Wales, where, on the 11th of November,
he married a widow of the name of James, and set up housekeeping
with borrowed furniture, though, according to an
announcement in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> his wife had a
fortune of £10,000. The rest of the year he spent chiefly
in Bristol and the west of England.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Charles Wesley, of course, alternated with his brother,
though he preached far more at Bristol than in London.
Ever and anon he composed one of his grand funereal hymns,
and not unfrequently met with amusing adventures. In a
Kingswood prayer-meeting, while he and others were praying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
for an increase of spiritual children, a wild collier brought
four of his black-faced little ones, and threw the youngest
on the table, saying, “You have got the mother, take the
bairns as well.” In another instance, a woman came to him
about her husband, who had been to hear the <i>predestinarian</i>
gospel, returned home <i>elect</i>, and, in proof of it, <i>beat his
wife</i>.</p>

<p>For some months, in the year 1741, Charles Wesley was in
danger of subsiding into Moravian <i>stillness</i>; and his brother
wrote to him, “The Philistines are upon thee, Samson, but
the Lord is not departed from thee.” Gambold also, and
Westley Hall, were inoculated with the same pernicious
poison. Charles went off to Bristol, and on April 21 Wesley
addressed to him the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I rejoice in your speaking your mind freely. O let our love be without
dissimulation!</p>

<p>“As yet, I dare in nowise join with the Moravians: 1. Because their
whole scheme is mystical, not scriptural. 2. Because there is darkness and
closeness in their whole behaviour, and guile in almost all their words.
3. Because they utterly deny and despise self denial and the daily cross.
4. Because they, upon principle, conform to the world, in wearing gold or
costly apparel. 5. Because they extend Christian liberty, in this and
many other respects, beyond what is warranted in holy writ. 6. Because
they are by no means zealous of good works; or, at least, only to their
own people. And, lastly, because they make inward religion swallow up
outward in general. For these reasons chiefly, I will rather stand quite
alone, than join with them: I mean till I have full assurance, that they
will spread none of their errors among the little flock committed to my
charge.</p>

<p>“O my brother, my soul is grieved for you; the poison is in you: fair
words have stolen away your heart. ‘No English man or woman is like
the Moravians!’ So the matter is come to a fair issue. Five of us did
still stand together a few months since; but two are gone to the right
hand, Hutchins and Cennick; and two more to the left, Mr. Hall and
you. Lord, if it be Thy gospel which I preach, arise and maintain Thine
own cause! Adieu!”<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the month of May, a reunion of Wesley’s London
society with the Moravians at Fetter Lane was solemnly
discussed; and all the bands met at the Foundery, on a
Wednesday afternoon, to ask God to give them guidance.
“It was clear to all,” writes Wesley, “even those who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
before the most desirous of reunion, that the time was not
come: (1) because the brethren of Fetter Lane had not
given up their most essentially erroneous doctrines; and,
(2) because many of us had found so much guile in their
words, that we could scarce tell what they really held, and
what not.”</p>

<p>Wesley entertained no bitterness towards the Moravians.
He readily acknowledges, that they had a sincere desire to
serve God; that many of them had tasted of His love
that they abstained from outward sin; and that their discipline,
in most respects, was excellent: but, after reading all
their English publications, and “waiving their odd and
affected phrases; their weak, mean, silly, childish expressions;
their crude, confused, and undigested notions; and their
whims, unsupported either by Scripture or sound reason,”—he
found three grand, unretracted errors running through almost
all their books, namely “universal salvation, antinomianism,
and a kind of new, reformed quietism.” No wonder that the
thought of reunion was abandoned.</p>

<p>A month after the above meeting, at the Foundery, Wesley
made a tour among the Moravians, in the midland counties.
Here Ingham had preached with great success; and here
Mr. Simpson, one of the Oxford Methodists, had settled as a
sort of Moravian minister. During the journey, Wesley made
an experiment which he had often been urged to make,
namely that of speaking to no one on sacred things, unless
his heart was free to it. The result was, that, for eighty miles
together, he had no need to speak at all; and he tells us that,
instead of having crosses to take up and bear, he commonly
fell fast asleep; and all behaved to him, as to a civil, good-natured
gentleman. On reaching Ockbrook, where Simpson
lived, he found that though, a few months before, there had
been a great awakening all round about, three-fourths of the
converts were now backsliders. Simpson had drawn the
people from the Church, and had advised them to abandon
devotion. He said, there was no Church of England left;
and that there was no scriptural command for family or
private prayer. The sum of his teaching was: “If you wish
to believe, be still; and leave off what you call the means of
grace, such as prayer and running to church and sacrament.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
Mr. Graves, the clergyman of the parish, having offered
the use of his church to Wesley, the latter preached two
sermons, one on “the true gospel stillness”, and the other
from his favourite text—“By grace are ye saved, through
faith.”</p>

<p>From Ockbrook, Wesley went to Nottingham, where he
found further evidences of backsliding. The room, which
used to be crowded, was now half empty; and the few who
did attend the services, instead of praying when they entered,
sat down without any religious formality whatever, and began
talking to their neighbours. When Wesley engaged in prayer
among them, none knelt, and “those who stood chose the
most easy and indolent posture which they conveniently
could.” One of the hymn-books, published by the Wesleys,
had been sent from London to be used in the public congregations;
but both that and the Bible were now banished;
and, in the place of them, lay the Moravian hymns and
Zinzendorf’s sixteen sermons. Wesley preached twice in
this Moravian meeting; and once in the market place, to
an immense multitude, all of whom, with two or three exceptions,
behaved with great decorum.</p>

<p>After spending a week at Markfield, Ockbrook, Nottingham,
Melbourn, and Hemmington, and also probably becoming
acquainted with the Countess of Huntingdon, who
lived in this locality, Wesley returned to town, on the 16th of
June, and, a fortnight after, went to Oxford, where he met
his old friend Mr. Gambold, who honestly told him, he was
ashamed of his company, and must be excused going to the
Moravian meeting with him.</p>

<p>At the beginning of September, Zinzendorf wished to have
an interview, and, at his request, Wesley went to Gray’s-inn
Walk, a public promenade, to meet him. Zinzendorf charged
him with having changed his religion; with having quarreled
with the Brethren; and with having refused to be at peace
with them, even after they had asked his forgiveness. In
reference to Wesley’s doctrine of Christian perfection, the
count became furious. “This,” said he, “is the error of errors.
I pursue it through the world with fire and sword. I
trample upon it. I devote it to utter destruction. Christ is
our sole perfection. Whoever follows inherent perfection, de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>nies
Christ. All Christian perfection is faith in the blood of
Christ; and is wholly imputed, not inherent.” Wesley
asked, if they were not striving about words; and, by a series
of questions, got the obfuscated German to admit, “that, a
believer is altogether holy in heart and life,—that he loves
God with all his heart, and serves Him with all his powers.”
Wesley continued: “I desire nothing more. I mean nothing
else by perfection, or Christian holiness.” Zinzendorf rejoined:
“But this is not the believer’s holiness. He is not
more holy if he loves more, or less holy, if he loves less.
In the moment he is justified, he is sanctified wholly; and,
from that time, he is neither more nor less holy, even unto
death. Our whole justification, and sanctification, are in
the same instant. From the moment any one is justified,
his heart is as pure as it ever will be.” Wesley asked again:
“Perhaps I do not comprehend your meaning. Do we not,
while we deny ourselves, die more and more to the world
and live to God?” Zinzendorf replied: “We reject all self
denial. We trample upon it. We do, as believers, whatsoever
we will, and nothing more. We laugh at all mortification.
No purification precedes perfect love.”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> And thus the conference
ended.</p>

<p>“The count,” said Mr. Stonehouse after reading the conversation,
“is a clever fellow; but the genius of Methodism is
too strong for him.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Zinzendorf accused Wesley of refusing to live in peace,
even after the Brethren had humbled themselves and begged
his pardon. Wesley says there is a mistake in this. Fifty or
more Moravians spoke bitterly against him; one or two asked
his pardon, but did it in the most careless manner possible.
The rest, if ashamed of their behaviour at all, managed to
keep their shame a profound secret from him.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>As to the count’s theory, that a man is wholly sanctified the
moment he is justified—a theory held by the Rev. Dr. Bunting,
at all events, at the commencement of his ministerial career<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>—we
say nothing; but there can be no question, that his sentiments
respecting self denial, and the right of believers to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
or not to do what they like, are, in a high degree, delusive
and dangerous. We have here the very essence of the antinomian
heresy, and are thus prepared for an entry in Charles
Wesley’s journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1741. September 6.—“I was astonished by a letter from my brother,
relating his conference with the apostle of the Moravians. Who would
believe it of Count Zinzendorf, that he should utterly deny all Christian
holiness? I never could, but for a saying of his, which I heard with my
own ears. Speaking of St. James’s epistle, he said: ‘If it was thrown
out of the canon, I would not restore it.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The heresy of such a man was of vast importance; for, in
this same year and month, September, 1741, Zinzendorf told
Doddridge, that he had “sent out, from his own family of
Moravians, three hundred preachers, who were gone into most
parts of the world; and that he himself was now become the
guardian of the Protestant churches in the south of France,
sixty of which were assembling privately for worship.”<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>As already stated, Charles Wesley was in danger of falling
into the Moravian heresy. The following is an extract from
a letter addressed to Wesley by the Countess of Huntingdon,
and dated October 24, 1741.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since you left us, the <i>still ones</i> are not without their attacks. I fear
much more for your brother than for myself, as the conquest of the one
would be nothing in respect to the other. They have, by one of their
agents, reviled me very much, but I have taken no sort of notice of it.
I comfort myself, that you will approve a step with respect to them, which
your brother and I have taken: no less than his declaring open war
against them. He seemed under some difficulty about it at first, till he
had free liberty given him to use my name, as the instrument, in God’s
hand, that had delivered him from them. I rejoiced much at it, hoping
it might be the means of working my deliverance from them. I have desired
him to enclose to them yours on Christian perfection. The doctrine
therein contained, I hope to live and die by; it is absolutely the most
complete thing I know. Your brother is also to give his reasons for
separating. I have great faith God will not let him fall; for many would
fall with him. His natural parts, his judgment, and the improvement he
has made, are so very far above the very highest of them, that I should
imagine nothing but frenzy had seized upon him.</p>

<p>“We set out a week ago for Donnington, and you shall hear from me
as soon as I arrive, and have heard how your little flock goes on in that
neighbourhood.”<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>Methodists will learn, from this interesting letter, that
they owe a debt of gratitude to the noble and “elect lady”
of the midland counties.</p>

<p>We turn to Whitefield. On his arrival from America, in
the month of March, he found his position far from pleasant.</p>

<p>First of all, there was the melancholy death of his friend,
William Seward—really Methodism’s first martyr—a man of
considerable property, but of meagre education and inferior
talent; Whitefield’s travelling companion in his second voyage
to Georgia, and who, at the time of his being murdered, in
Wales, was itinerating with Howel Harris in Glamorganshire.
At Newport, the mob had torn Harris’s coat to tatters, stolen
his wig, and pelted him and his companion with apples, stones,
and dirt. At Caerleon, rotten eggs were thrown in all directions,
Seward’s eye was struck, and, a few days after, he was
entirely blind. At Monmouth, their treatment was of the
same kind as at Newport and Caerleon; but Seward bravely
cried, “Better endure this than hell.” At length, on reaching
Hay, a villain hit him on the head; the blow was fatal;
and William Seward went to inherit a martyr’s crown, at the
early age of thirty-eight, on October 22, 1741.</p>

<p>Besides the death of Methodism’s protomartyr, there were
other troubles which Whitefield had to carry. He had an
orphan family of nearly a hundred persons to maintain; was
above a thousand pounds in debt for them; and was threatened
with arrest on account of a bill for £350, drawn, in favour of
the orphan house by his dead friend, William Seward, but
which had not been met by him. James Hutton, who had
been his publisher, refused to have any further transactions
with him. “Many of my spiritual children,” he writes, “who,
when I last left England, would have plucked out their own
eyes to have given me, are so prejudiced by the dear Messrs.
Wesleys’ dressing up of election in such horrible colours, that
they will neither hear, see, nor give me the least assistance.
Yea, some of them send threatening letters, that God will
speedily destroy me. As for the people of the world, they
are so embittered by my <i>injudicious</i> and <i>too severe</i> expressions
against Archbishop Tillotson, the author of the old Duty
of Man, that they fly from me as from a viper; and, what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
worst of all, I am now constrained, on account of our differing
in principles, publicly to separate from my dear, dear old
friends, Messrs. John and Charles Wesley.”<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>During his passage to England, Whitefield wrote to Charles
Wesley as follows: “My dear, dear brother, why did you
throw out the bone of contention? Why did <i>you</i> print that
sermon against predestination? Why did you, in particular,
affix your hymn and join in putting out your late hymn-book?
How can you say you will not dispute with me about
election, and yet print such hymns?” And then he proceeds
to state, that he had written an answer to Wesley’s sermon
on free grace, and was about to have it printed in Charlestown,
Boston, and London.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>About six weeks before his arrival in England, some one
obtained a copy of the letter he had sent to Wesley, under
the date of September 25, 1740,<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> (an extract of which is
given in the previous chapter, page 316,) and had printed
it without either his or Wesley’s consent, and circulated it
gratuitously at the doors of the Foundery. Wesley heard
of this; and, having procured a copy, tore it in pieces before
the assembled congregation, declaring that he believed
Whitefield would have done the same. The congregation
imitated their minister’s example, and, in two minutes, all
the copies were literally torn to tatters.</p>

<p>Three weeks after this, Wesley had to hurry off to Kingswood
to allay the turmoils there. He met the bands, but it
was a cold uncomfortable meeting. Cennick and fifteen or
twenty of his friends had an interview with Wesley, who
accused them of speaking against him behind his back.
They replied that they had said nothing behind his back
which they would not say before his face; namely, that he
preached up the faithfulness of man, and not the faithfulness
of God.</p>

<p>After a lovefeast, held in Bristol on Sunday evening,
February 22, Wesley related to the Bristol Methodists, that
many of their brethren at Kingswood had formed themselves
into a separate society, on account of Cennick preaching doc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>trines
different to those preached by himself and his brother.
Cennick, who was present, affirmed, that Wesley’s doctrine
was false. Wesley charged him with supplanting him in his
own house, stealing the hearts of the people, and, by private
accusations, dividing very friends. Cennick replied, “I have
never privately accused you.” Wesley, who, by some means,
was possessed of a letter which Cennick had recently addressed
to Whitefield, answered: “My brethren, judge;” and then
began to read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>January 17, 1741.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—That you might come quickly, I have written
a second time. I sit solitary, like Eli, waiting what will become of the
ark. My trouble increases daily. How glorious did the gospel seem once
to flourish in Kingswood! I spake of the everlasting love of Christ with
sweet power; but now brother Charles is suffered to open his mouth
against this truth, while the frighted sheep gaze and fly, as if no shepherd
was among them. O, pray for the distressed lambs yet left in this place,
that they faint not! Brother Charles pleases the world with universal
redemption, and brother John follows him in everything. No atheist
can preach more against predestination than they; and all who believe
election are counted enemies to God, and called so. Fly, dear brother.
I am as alone; I am in the midst of the plague. If God give thee leave,
make haste.”</p>
</div>

<p>Cennick acknowledged the letter was his, that it had been
sent to Whitefield, and that he retracted nothing in it. The
meeting got excited, and Wesley adjourned the settlement
of the business to Kingswood on Saturday next ensuing.</p>

<p>Here he heard all that any one wished to say, and then
read the following paper:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">By</span> many witnesses, it appears that several members of the band
society in Kingswood have made it their common practice to scoff at the
preaching of Mr. John and Charles Wesley; that they have censured and
spoken evil of them behind their backs, at the very time they professed
love and esteem to their faces; that they have studiously endeavoured
to prejudice other members of that society against them; and, in order
thereto, have belied and slandered them in divers instances.</p>

<p>“Therefore, not for their opinions, nor for any of them (whether they be
right or wrong), but for the causes above mentioned, viz. for their scoffing
at the word and ministers of God, for their talebearing, backbiting, and
evil speaking, for their dissembling, lying, and slandering:</p>

<p>“I, John Wesley, by the consent and approbation of the band society
in Kingswood, do declare the persons above mentioned to be no longer
members thereof. Neither will they be so accounted, until they shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
openly confess their fault, and thereby do what in them lies, to remove the
scandal they have given.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is a remarkable document It was hardly two years
since Whitefield and Wesley began to preach at Kingswood,
and yet here we have a large number of their converts
charged with backbiting, lying, slandering, and other crimes.
“How is the gold become dim!” Were the former days
better than these? We doubt it.</p>

<p>Here we also have the first Methodist expulsion; not for
opinions, but for sins; not by the sole authority and act of
John Wesley, but “by the consent and approbation” of the
society, whose refractory members were to be put away.
Such was Methodism, at its beginning.</p>

<p>Cennick, and those who sympathised with his sentiments,
refused to own that they had done aught amiss; and declared
that, on many occasions, he had heard both Wesley and his
brother preach Popery. Wesley gave them another week to
think the matter over. They were still intractable; and
alleged that the <i>real</i> cause of their expulsion was their
holding the doctrine of election. Wesley answered, “You
know in your conscience it is not. There are several predestinarians
in our societies both at London and Bristol, nor did I
ever put any one out of either because he held that opinion.”
The result of the whole was, Cennick and fifty-one others at
once withdrew, and the remainder, numbering about a
hundred, still adhered to Wesley.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Such was the first schism in Methodist history,—John
Cennick the leader,—fifty of the Kingswood members its
abettors,—and John Wesley and a majority of the Kingswood
society, the court enacting their expulsion.</p>

<p>The writer’s chief object is to furnish facts, and therefore he
refrains from comment on these transactions. No doubt
Cennick was sincere. After the risks he ran in preaching
Christ, no one can doubt his Christian earnestness: but,
having come to Kingswood at Wesley’s invitation, and
having been employed by him as the teacher of his school,
and also as an evangelist among the surrounding colliers, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
would, at least, have been more courteous to have quietly
retired from his present sphere of action, when he found his
views different from those of his patron and his friend, than
it was for him to pursue the controversial and divisive course
he did. John Cennick had a lion’s courage and a martyr’s
piety; but his passions sometimes mastered his prudence, and,
for want of the serpent’s wisdom, he often failed in exhibiting
the meekness of the dove.</p>

<p>Whitefield arrived in London a few days after the Kingswood
expulsion; and Wesley, on the 25th of March, hastened
off to meet him. Whitefield told him they preached two
different gospels, and that he was resolved to preach against
him and his brother wherever he preached at all. A weekly
publication, of four folio pages, entitled “The Weekly
History; or An Account of the most remarkable Particulars
relating to the present Progress of the Gospel,” was immediately
started by J. Lewis, Whitefield promising to
supply him with fresh matter every week. This was really
the first Methodist newspaper ever published. Of course,
Calvinism was its inspiring genius. The principal contributors
were Whitefield, Cennick, Howel Harris, and Joseph
Humphreys.</p>

<p>The last mentioned was employed by Wesley as a sort of
Moravian lay preacher, as early as the year 1738,<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and was
greatly attached to him. At this period, he was acting as
Moravian minister at Deptford, and wrote to Wesley as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Deptford</span>, <i>April 5, 1741</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear and reverend Sir</span>,—I think I love you better than ever. I
would not grieve you by any means, if I could possibly help it. I think I
had never more power in preaching than I had this morning. And, if
this is the consequence of electing everlasting love, may my soul be ever
filled with it!”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In another letter, of three weeks later date, addressed to
“Mr. M——,” he avows his belief in the doctrine of final
perseverance, and proceeds to say:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The doctrine of sinless perfection in this life, I utterly renounce. I
believe the preaching of it has led many souls into darkness and con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>fusion.
I believe those that hold it, if children of God at all, are in a
very legal state. I believe those who pretend to have attained it are
dangerously ignorant of their own hearts. I also see that, if I incline
towards universal redemption any longer, I must also hold with universal
salvation.”</p>
</div>

<p>He then adds: “Last Saturday I sent the following letter
to the Rev. Mr. J. Wesley.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,—I would have been joined with you to all eternity
if I could; but my having continued with you so long as I have has led
me into grievous temptation; and I now think it my duty no longer to
join with you, but openly to renounce your peculiar doctrines. I have
begun to do it at London; and, as the Lord shall enable me, will proceed
to do it here at Bristol. I feel no bitterness in my spirit, but love you,
pray for you, and respect you.</p>

<p class="psig">
“I am, sir, your humble servant and unworthy brother,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Joseph Humphreys</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The above letter was sent to the editor of the <i>Weekly
History</i> by Whitefield, accompanied by the following note:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I would have you print this letter with my last. If you think it best,
I would also have it printed in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>. I see the mystery
of iniquity, that is working, more and more.</p>

<p class="psig">
“Ever yours,<br />
“<span class="smcap">G. Whitefield</span>.“<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Humphreys and Cennick were now both at Kingswood,
which was, for the time being, the head quarters of the
Calvinistic schism. Here, in the month of April, the separatists
got, from an old man, his copy of Wesley’s treatise
against predestination, and burnt it.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> About the same time,
however, Wesley distributed a thousand copies among
Whitefield’s congregation, and a thousand more at the
Foundery;<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> and, in the same month, addressed the following
characteristic letter to his friend.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>April, 1741.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“Would you have me deal plainly with you? I believe you would;
then, by the grace of God, I will.</p>

<p>“Of many things I find you are not rightly informed; of others you
speak what you have not well weighed.</p>

<p>“‘The society room at Bristol,’ you say, ‘ is adorned,’ How? Why,
with a piece of green cloth nailed to the desk; and two sconces for eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
candles each in the middle. I know no more. Now, which of these can
be spared I know not; nor would I desire more adorning, or less.</p>

<p>“But ‘lodgings are made for me and my brother,’ That is, in plain
English, there is a little room by the school, where I speak to the persons
who come to me; and a garret, in which a bed is placed for me. And
do you grudge me this? Is this the voice of my brother, my son,
Whitefield?</p>

<p>“You say further, ‘that the children at Bristol are clothed as well as
taught,’ I am sorry for it, for the cloth is not paid for yet, and was
bought without my consent, or knowledge. ‘But those at Kingswood
have been neglected,’ This is not so, notwithstanding the heavy debt
that lay upon it. One master and one mistress have been in the house
ever since it was capable of receiving them. A second master has been
placed there some months since; and I have long been seeking for two
proper mistresses; so that as much has been done, as matters stand,
if not more, than I can answer to God and man.</p>

<p>“Hitherto, then, there is no ground for the heavy charge of perverting
your design for the poor colliers. Two years since, your design was to
build them a school. To this end, you collected some money more than
once; how much I cannot say, till I have my papers. But this I know,
it was not near one-half of what has been expended on the work. This
design you then recommended to me, and I pursued it with all my might,
through such a train of difficulties as, I will be bold to say, you have not
met with in your life. For many months, I collected money wherever I
was, and began building, though I had not then a quarter of the money
requisite to finish. However, taking all the debt upon myself, the
creditors were willing to stay; and then it was that I took possession of
it in my own name; that is, when the foundation was laid; and I
immediately made my will, fixing you and my brother to succeed me
therein.</p>

<p>“But it is a poor case, that you and I should be talking thus. Indeed,
these things ought not to be. It lay in your power to have prevented all,
and yet to have borne testimony to what you call ‘the truth.’ If you had
disliked my sermon, you might have printed another on the same text, and
have answered my proofs, without mentioning my name; this had been
fair and friendly.”</p>
</div>

<p>The two friends were thus at variance; but every candid
reader must honestly acknowledge, that Wesley triumphantly
refutes Whitefield’s petulant objections.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Whitefield’s adherents in the metropolis, within
a few days after his arrival, set to work to erect him a wooden
building near the Foundery, which they called “a Tabernacle,
for morning’s exposition.”<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> On April 25, he went to Bristol,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
where Charles Wesley was officiating; and, three weeks after,
wrote to a friend, saying, “The doctrines of the gospel are
sadly run down, and most monstrous errors propagated.
They assert, ‘that the very in-being of sin must be taken out
of us, or otherwise we are not new creatures,’ However, at
Bristol, error is in a great measure put a stop to.”<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>So Whitefield thought, and yet, at this very time, Charles
Wesley was preaching at Bristol and Kingswood, if possible,
with greater power than ever. In June, however, Whitefield
began to collect money for a rival meeting-house at Kingswood,
and wished John Cennick to lay the foundation
immediately, but to take care not to make the building either
too large or too handsome.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Wesley and Whitefield were divided; but Howel Harris,
with his warm Welsh heart, tried to reunite them. In the
month of October, Harris had loving interviews with both
Wesley and his brother, and wrote to Whitefield, then in
Scotland. Whitefield, easily moved in the path of Christian
love, immediately addressed to Wesley the letter following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>, <i>October 10, 1741</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Brother</span>,—This morning I received a letter
from brother Harris, telling me how he had conversed with you and your
dear brother. May God remove all obstacles that now prevent our
union! Though I hold particular election, yet I offer Jesus freely to
every individual soul. You may carry sanctification to what degrees you
will, only I cannot agree with you that the in-being of sin is to be destroyed
in this life. In about three weeks, I hope to be at Bristol. May
all disputings cease, and each of us talk of nothing but Jesus and Him
crucified! This is my resolution. I am, without dissimulation,</p>

<p class="psig">
“Ever yours,<br />
“<span class="smcap">G. Whitefield</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It was nearly two years after this that Wesley wrote the
piece, in his collected works, entitled, “Calvinistic Controversy”
(vol. xiii., p. 478). He says:—</p>

<p>“Having found for some time a strong desire to unite with
Mr. Whitefield, as far as possible, to cut off needless dispute,
I wrote down my sentiments, as plain as I could, in the following
terms:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>“There are three points in debate: 1. Unconditional
election. 2. Irresistible grace. 3. Final perseverance.”</p>

<p>With regard to the first, Wesley expresses his belief, that
God has unconditionally elected certain persons to do certain
work, and certain nations to receive peculiar privileges; and
allows, though he says he cannot prove, that God “has unconditionally
elected some persons, thence eminently styled
‘the elect,’ to eternal glory;” but he cannot believe, that all
those, not thus elected to glory, must perish everlastingly;
or, that there is a soul on earth but what has the chance of
escaping eternal damnation.</p>

<p>With regard to irresistible grace, he believes, that the grace
which brings faith, and, thereby, salvation, is irresistible at
that moment; and, that most believers may remember a time
when God irresistibly convinced them of sin, and other times
when He acted irresistibly upon their souls; but he also
believes, that the grace of God, both before and after these
moments, may be, and hath been resisted; and that, in
general, it does not act irresistibly, but we may comply
therewith, or may not. In those eminently styled “the elect”
(if such there be), the grace of God is so far irresistible, that
they cannot but believe, and be finally saved; but it is not
true, that all those must be damned in whom it does not thus
irresistibly work, or, that there is a soul living who has not
any other grace than such as was designed of God to increase
his damnation.</p>

<p>With regard to final perseverance, he believes, “that there
is a state attainable in this life, from which a man cannot
finally fall; and that he has attained this, who can say, ‘Old
things are passed away; all things in me are become new;’
and, further, he does not deny, that all those eminently styled
‘the elect’ will infallibly persevere to the end.”<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>In reference to “the elect,” Henry Moore adds, that Wesley
told him, that, when he wrote this, he believed, with Macarius,
that all who are perfected in love are thus elect.</p>

<p>The document from which the above is taken, was written
in 1743. As Mr. Jackson says, it “evidently leans too much
towards Calvinism.” It is valuable chiefly because it shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
Wesley’s anxiety to be at peace with Whitefield. The latter
writes as though all the blame, in reference to the rupture in
their friendship, lay with Wesley; whereas this was far from
being true. Wesley honestly and firmly believed the doctrine
of general redemption; and, because he preached it, and
published a sermon in condemnation of the doctrines opposed
to it, Whitefield worked himself into a fume, and wrote his
pamphlet, in which he not only tries to refute Wesley’s teaching,
but unnecessarily makes a personal attack on Wesley’s
character, and taunts him about casting lots,—a wanton outrage,
for which, in October, 1741, he humbly begged his
pardon.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> The intolerant, excessive zeal was altogether on
the side of Whitefield. Wesley believed and preached
general redemption; but raised no objection to Whitefield
believing and preaching election and final perseverance. Instead
of reciprocating this, Whitefield, in his pamphlet,
blustered; and, in his letters, whined, until the difference of
opinion disturbed their friendship, and led them to build
separate chapels, form separate societies, and pursue, to the
end of life, separate lines of action. One of Wesley’s friends
wished him to reply to Whitefield’s pamphlet. Wesley answered,
“You may read Whitefield against Wesley; but you
shall never read Wesley against Whitefield.”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> In private,
Wesley opposed Whitefield, but in public never. On one
occasion, when the two friends met in a large social gathering,
Whitefield mounted his hobby, and spoke largely and
valiantly in defence of his favourite system. Wesley, on the
other hand, was silent till all the company were gone, when,
turning to the spurred and belted controversial knight, he
quietly remarked, “Brother, are you aware of what you have
done to-night?” “Yes,” said Whitefield, “I have defended
truth.” “You have tried to prove,” replied Wesley, “that
God is worse than the devil; for the devil can only <i>tempt</i> a
man to sin; but, if what you have said be true, God <i>forces</i> a
man to sin; and therefore, on your own system, God is worse
than the devil.”<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Thus the gulf between Wesley and Whitefield was immense.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
“It was undesirable—indeed, it was impossible—that they
should continue to address, in turn, the same congregations;
for such congregations would have been kept in the pitiable
condition of a ship, thrown on its beam ends, larboard and
starboard, by hurricanes driving alternately east and west.”<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Being separated from Whitefield and the Moravians, Wesley
began to purge and to organise the societies, which were now
purely and properly his own. At Bristol, he took an account
of every person—(1) to whom any reasonable objection was
made; and (2) who was not known to and recommended by
some, on whose veracity he could depend. To those who
were sufficiently recommended, he gave tickets. Most of the
rest he had face to face with their accusers; and such as appeared
to be innocent, or confessed their faults and promised
better behaviour, were then received into the society. The
others were put upon trial again, unless they voluntarily expelled
themselves. By this purging process, about forty were
excluded.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> He also appointed stewards, to receive and expend
what was contributed weekly; and, finding the funds
insufficient, he discharged two of the Bristol schoolmasters,
retaining still, at Kingswood and Bristol unitedly, three
masters and two mistresses for the two schools respectively.</p>

<p>In London, he adopted the same process, and set apart the
hours from ten to two, on every day but Saturday, for speaking
with the bands and other persons, that no disorderly
walker, nor any of a careless or contentious spirit, might
remain among them; the result of which was the society
was reduced to about a thousand members.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Ascertaining
that many of the members were without needful food, and
destitute of convenient clothing, he appointed twelve persons
to visit every alternate day, and to provide things needful
for the sick; also to meet once a week to give an account
of their proceedings, and to consult what could be done
further. Women, out of work, he proposed to employ in
knitting, giving them the common price for the work they
did, and then adding gratuities according to their needs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
To meet these expenses, he requested those who could afford
it, to give a penny weekly, and to contribute any clothing
which their own use did not require.</p>

<p>Here we have a new Methodist agency employed. Wesley
had already permitted laymen to exhort and preach; he now
authorised them to pay pastoral visits among his people. At
present, they were <i>mere visitors</i>, and meetings analogous to
the class-meetings of the present day did not exist. The two
Wesleys often addressed the societies apart, after they had
dismissed the general congregation. They also fixed certain
hours for private conversation; and now they appointed visitors
to visit those who through sickness, poverty, or other causes,
were not able to avail themselves of such assistance. This, as
yet, was all. In the present sense, bands and classes there
were none, except that each society, after the manner of the
Moravians, was divided into male and female, and, perhaps,
married and unmarried, bands, all of them watched over by
Wesley or by his brother; and the sick and poor among them
visited by persons appointed to that office. In Bristol, several
members applied to Wesley for baptism, and he gave the
bishop notice to that effect, adding, that they desired him to
baptize them by immersion.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The Kingswood society, having
been repelled from the sacramental table at Temple church,
Charles Wesley gave them the sacrament in their own humble
school; and, notwithstanding his high churchism, declared
that, under the circumstances, if they had not had the
school, he should have felt himself justified in administering
it in the wood. In London, some of the members communicated
at St. Paul’s, or at their own parish churches; but, during
the autumn, on five successive Sundays, Wesley availed himself
of the offer of Mr. Deleznot, a French clergyman, and used his
small church, in Hermitage Street, Wapping, in administering
the Lord’s supper to five successive batches of about two
hundred members of his society (as many as the place could
well contain), until all the society, consisting of about a
thousand persons, had received it.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>To the members at Bristol, and doubtless also at London,
Wesley gave <i>tickets</i>. On every ticket he wrote, with his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
hand, the member’s name, “so that,” says he, “the ticket
implied as strong a recommendation of the person to whom
it was given as if I had wrote at length, ‘I believe the bearer
hereof to be one that fears God and works righteousness.’”</p>

<p>Wesley regarded these tickets as being equivalent to the
επιστολαι συστατικαι, “commendatory letters,” mentioned by
the apostle, and says they were of use: (1) because, wherever
those who bore them came, they were acknowledged by their
brethren, and received with all cheerfulness; (2) when the
societies had to meet apart, the tickets easily distinguished
who were members and who were not; (3) they supplied a
quiet and inoffensive method of removing any disorderly
member; for, the tickets being changed once a quarter, and,
of course, no new ticket being given to such a person, it was
hereby immediately known that he was no longer a member
of the community.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>The writer is possessed of nearly a complete set of these
society tickets, from the first, issued about 1742, to those given
a hundred years afterwards. Many of them bear the autographs
of John and Charles Wesley, William Grimshaw, and
other old Methodist worthies. The earliest are wood and
copper-plate engravings, printed on cardboard, without any
text of Scripture: some bearing the emblem of an angel
flying in the clouds of heaven, with one trumpet to his
mouth, and a second in his hand; and others of the Sun of
Righteousness shining on a phœnix rising out of fire. Some
have a dove encircled with glory; and others have no
engraving whatever, but simply an inscription, written by
Charles Wesley, “August, 1746.” Some merely have the
word “Society” imprinted, with the member’s name written
underneath; others have a lamb carrying a flag; and others
a tree with a broken stem, Jehovah as a sun shining on it,
and at its foot two men, one planting a new cutting, and
the other watering one already planted. Some represent
Christ in the clouds of heaven, with the cross in one hand
and a crown in the other; and others represent the Christian
kneeling before an altar, inscribed with the words, “Pray
always and faint not.” One represents Christ as washing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
disciple’s feet; and another, with a text of Scripture at the
top, has four lines below, in which are printed, “March 25,
June 25, September 29, December 25,” with space left
opposite to each for writing the member’s name, and so
making one ticket serve for the four quarters of a year.
One bears the impress of an anchor and a crown; and
another the image of old father Time, hurrying along,
with a scroll in his hand, inscribed with “Now is the accepted
time.” Some are printed with black ink, some with
red, and some with blue. About 1750, emblems gave place
to texts of Scripture, which have been continued from that
time to this.</p>

<p>The Methodist societies, as organised by Wesley, were thus
fairly started in 1741. Meanwhile, Methodism on earth began
to swell the inhabitants of heaven. At the very commencement
of the year, Elizabeth Davis, of London, after she was
speechless, being desired to hold up her hand if she knew she
was going to God, immediately held up both. Anne Cole,
on being asked by Wesley, whether she chose to live or die,
answered: “I choose neither, I choose nothing. I am in my
Saviour’s hands, and I have no will but His.” Another of
the London members, when visited by Wesley, said: “I am
very ill,—but I am very well. O, I am happy, happy, happy!
My spirit continually rejoices in God my Saviour. Life or
death is all one to me. I have no darkness, no cloud. My
body indeed is weak and in pain, but my soul is all joy
and praise.” Jane Muncy exclaimed: “I faint not, I murmur
not, I rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks.
God is ever with me, and I have nothing to do but praise
Him.” In Bristol, a woman in her dying agonies cried
out: “O, how loving is God to me! But He is loving to
every man, and loves every soul as well as He loves mine.”
The last words of another were, “Death stares me in the
face, but I fear him not.” Hannah Richardson, who was
followed to her grave by the whole of the Bristol society,
the procession being pelted in the streets with dirt and
stones, said: “I have no fear, no doubt, no trouble. Heaven
is open! I see Jesus Christ with all His angels and saints in
white. I see what I cannot utter or express.” Sister Hooper
cried, “I am in great pain, but in greater joy.” Sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
Lillington exclaimed, “I never felt such love before; I love
every soul: I am all love, and so is God.” Rachel Peacock
sang hymns incessantly, and was so filled with joy that she
shouted: “Though I groan, I feel no pain at all; Christ so
rejoices and fills my heart.”<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> And to all these may be added
Keziah Wesley. In a letter to his brother, dated March 9,
1741, Charles Wesley writes: “Yesterday morning, sister
Kezzy died in the Lord Jesus. He finished His work, and
cut it short in mercy. Full of thankfulness, resignation, and
love, without pain or trouble, she commended her spirit into
the hands of Jesus, and fell asleep.”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>These were triumphs in the midst of troubles; for, besides
the anxiety and pain arising out of the differences with
Whitefield and the Moravians, Wesley, in 1741, had to
encounter no inconsiderable amount of unprincipled persecution.
At Deptford, while he was preaching, “many poor
wretches were got together, utterly devoid both of common
sense and common decency, who cried aloud, as if just
come from ‘among the tombs.’” In London, on Shrove
Tuesday, “many men of the baser sort” mixed themselves
with the female part of his congregation, and behaved with
great indecency. “A constable commanded them to keep the
peace, in answer to which they knocked him down.” In Long
Lane, while Wesley was preaching, the mob pelted him with
stones, one of great size passing close past his head. In
Marylebone fields, in the midst of his sermon, out of doors,
missiles fell thick and fast on every side. In Charles Square,
Hoxton, the rabble brought an ox which they endeavoured
to drive through the congregation. A man, who happened to
be a Dissenting minister, after hearing him preach at Chelsea,
asked, “<i>Quid est tibi nomen?</i>” and, on Wesley not answering
his impertinence, the pedantic puppy turned in triumph to
his friends, and said, “Ah! I told you he did not understand
Latin.” Among other slanders concerning him, it was currently
reported that he had paid a fine of £20, for selling
Geneva gin; that he kept in his house two popish priests;
that he had received large remittances from Spain, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
to make a party among the poor; and that, as soon as the
Spaniards landed, he was to join them with twenty thousand
men. It was also rumoured, that, in Bristol, he had
hanged himself, and had been cut down just in time to save
his life. The <i>Scots Magazine</i>, for August, had a scurrilous
article to the following effect. Above thirty Methodists had
been in Bedlam, and six were there at present. Wesley
had set up, at his Moorfields meeting-house, a number of
spinning wheels, where girls who had absconded from their
homes, and servants who had been discharged for neglecting
their master’s business, were set to work, and were allowed
sixpence daily, the overplus of their earnings going into
Wesley’s pocket. Boys and girls mixed together, and were
taught to call each other brother and sister in the Lord.
They had to greet each other with a holy kiss, and to
show the utmost affection and fondness, in imitation of the
primitive Christians. In the rooms adjoining the spinning
wheels were several beds, and when persons, in the Foundery
congregation, fell into fits, either pretended or real, they were
carried out and laid upon these beds, that Wesley might pray
the evil spirits out of them, and the good spirit into them, and
thus convert them.</p>

<p>In refutation of this tissue of unmingled falsehoods, a
writer says, in the same magazine, that he had visited the
Foundery, and found it “an old open house, like the tennis
court at Edinburgh;” but there were no bedchambers, and no
spinning wheels; and, consequently, no runaway girls nor
discarded menials. And, so far from above thirty Methodists
having been sent to Bedlam, the writer had made inquiry in
London, and was unable to hear of one.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, for the same year (page 26), has
a ridiculous letter, purporting to be from a Methodist to a
clergyman, in which the clergyman is charged with turning
“the <i>Scripters</i> upside down,” and with calling the Methodists
“<i>expownding infildelfels</i>.” Appended to the letter are annotations,
stating that, in a certain barn, twenty or thirty
Methodists rendezvous to hear a young schoolmaster preach,
pray, and sing Wesley’s hymns; and that, recently, a mob of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
juveniles had chastised his ambition by throwing snowballs at
him; but the preaching pedagogue, instead of ceasing, had
cheered himself by singing hymns suitable to such adventurers;
and a cobbler’s wife had been so excited by his dissertations
upon the pangs of the new birth, that she imagined
herself pregnant with devils, had been delivered of two or
three, but still felt others struggling within her.</p>

<p>The <i>Weekly Miscellany</i> tells its readers that, in the assemblies
of the expounding houses, lately erected in the outskirts
of London by the Methodists, any one, who conceits himself
inwardly moved, immediately sets up for a Scripture expounder.
In a long article, it pretends to show that the
Methodist preachers are like the German Anabaptists—1.
Because they act contrary to the oaths they have taken. 2.
Because of their invectives against the clergy. 3. Because
they are against all rule and authority. 4. Because they let
laymen and also women preach. 5. Because they preach in
the streets. 6. Because they denounce vengeance and damnation
against sinners. 7. Because they contend for absolute
perfection in this life. 8. Because they pretend to be always
guided by the Holy Ghost. And, 9. Because they hold the
doctrine of community of goods.</p>

<p>The same abusive but vigorously written paper contains an
attack upon the poor Methodists, by Hooker, the editor,
begun in the number for March 14, and continued weekly
until June 27, when this scolding periodical came to a well
deserved termination. The following are a few selections:—</p>

<p>March 28.—Wesley pretends to cast out spirits from those
whom he declares possessed of them; but he is “a grand,
empty, inconsistent heretic; the ringleader, fomenter, and
first cause of all the divisions, separations, factions, and feuds
that have happened in Oxford, London, Bristol, and other
places where he has been.”</p>

<p>April 25.—Wesley rebaptizes adults, on the ground that,
<i>really</i> they have never been baptized before, the baptism of
infants by sprinkling being no true baptism in his esteem.
When Whitefield returned from Georgia, he preached at the
Foundery, taking for his text, “O foolish Galatians, who hath
bewitched you?” For this he was immediately excommunicated
from the Foundery pulpit, lest the people should think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
that Wesley was a conjuror. “Everybody allows that there
are above twenty, and some say forty, spinning wheels at the
Foundery.” “Wesley well knows how to breakfast with one
of his devotees, dine with another, and sup with a third, all of
which retrenches the charges of housekeeping at home. Those
who sit in his gallery must subscribe five shillings a quarter,
and those who stand, a penny a week. He who advances
half-a-crown a quarter is admitted into the close society; and
he who doubles that amount becomes a member of the bands,
where men and women stay all night, but for what purpose is
known only to God and to themselves. The price for
resolving cases of conscience is threepence each. Wesley
makes at least £50 by every edition of the hymns he
publishes; and thus, by his preaching, his bookselling, his
workhouse, his wheedling, and his sponging, it is generally
believed that he gets an income of £700 a year, and some say
above £1000. This,” adds the mendacious editor, “is priest-craft
in perfection.”</p>

<p>May 9.—The writer speculates concerning what is likely to
be the end of the Methodist movement. 1. Some think if the
Methodists are let alone, they will, as a matter of course, fall
to pieces. 2. Others think that the irreconcilable differences
between Wesley and Whitefield will effect their ruin; for
Whitefield has set up a conventicle of boards not far from
Wesley’s Foundery; and while one calls the other schismatic,
the other in requital calls him a heretic. 3. Some
think that their congregations, by neglecting their business
and their work, will be reduced to beggary, and this, of
course, will ruin all. 4. Lastly, others think their conduct
will be such that the government will find it necessary to
suppress them.</p>

<p>June 13.—Proposes the erection of a Methodist edifice on
Blackheath. The foundation stone is to be the tombstone
that prevented the resurrection of Dr. Emes, the famous
French prophet. The principal entrance is to be adorned
with statues of the most eminent field-preachers. The hall is
to be decorated with a piece, in which the principal figure is
to be Enthusiasm, sitting in an easy chair, and just delivered
of two beauteous babes, the one called Superstition, and the
other Infidelity. On her right hand must be a grisly old gen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>tleman
with a cloven foot, holding the new born children in
a receiver, which the Pope has blessed, and gazing upon them
with most fatherly affection. The <i>pang room</i> of the building
is to be for the accommodation of those seized with the pangs
of the new birth. All who run mad about election must be
lodged in the <i>predestination room</i>,—which, by the way, is
likely to be well peopled, and therefore must be large, as well
as dark and gloomy, and must be adorned with the evolutions,
intricacies, and involutions of a rusty chain, held at one end
by the Methodistic founder, and at the other by the devil.
The <i>disputation room</i> is, like a cockpit, to be round as a
hoop, so that the disputants may have the pleasure of disputing
in a circle. The <i>expounding room</i> is to be adorned
with a picture of the founder, with a pair of scissors in one
hand and a Bible in the other; a motto over his reverend
head, “Dividing the word of God;” and all round about scraps
of paper supposed to be texts newly clipped from the sacred
Scriptures. The <i>refectory</i> is to have a painting to represent
Wesley, Whitefield, and C. Graves at supper, with Madam
Bourignon presiding. Near her must be an ass’s head boiled
with sprouts and bacon; and, at the other end of the table, a
dish of owls roasted and larded. Having already helped
Whitefield to the jaw bone of the ass’s head, and Wesley to
the sweet tooth, she now gives Mr. Graves a spoonful of the
brains and a bit of tongue, which he receives with a grateful
bow. The foundation stone is to be laid on the first of April;
and the procession to the site are to sing, not the psalms of
David, for they are not half good enough, but a hymn of
Wesley’s own composing.</p>

<p>Ridicule like this was even worse than being pelted with
brickbats and rotten eggs.</p>

<p>The two Wesleys and Whitefield were often roughly treated;
and so also was John Cennick, the Methodist Moravian. At
Swindon, the mob surrounded his congregation, rung a bell,
blew a horn, and used a fire engine in drenching him and
them with water. Guns were fired over the people’s heads, and
rotten eggs were plentiful.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> At Hampton, near Gloucester,
the rabble, chiefly soldiers, to annoy him, beat a drum and let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
off squibs and crackers. For an hour and a half, hog’s wash
and fœtid water were poured upon him and his congregation,
who all the while stood perfectly still, in secret prayer, with
their eyes and hands lifted up to heaven.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> At Stratton, a
crowd of furious men came, armed with weapons, clubs, and
staves. Cudgels were used most unmercifully. Some of his
congregation had blood streaming down their faces; others,
chiefly women, were dragged away by the hair of their head.
Sylvester Keen spat in the face of Cennick’s sister, and beat her
about the head, as if he meant to kill her. The mob bellowed
and roared like maniacs; but Cennick kept on preaching and
praying till he was violently pulled down; when he and his
friends set out for Lineham, singing hymns, and followed
by the crowd, who bawled—“You cheating dog, you pickpocketing
rogue, sell us a halfpenny ballad!”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of such treatment, Methodism went on its
way, and prospered. It is a remarkable fact, that, during
1741, there were no <i>stricken</i> cases, like those which occurred in
1739, excepting two at Bristol; but there were many signal
seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord. A man,
who had been an atheist for twenty years, came to the
Foundery to make sport, but was so convinced of sin, that
he rested not until he found peace with God. At Bristol,
on one occasion, “some wept aloud, some clapped their
hands, some shouted, and the rest sang praise.” In Charles
Square, London, while a violent storm was raging, “their
hearts danced for joy, praising ‘the glorious God that maketh
the thunder.’”</p>

<p>Two or three other important events, occurring in the year
1741, must be noticed.</p>

<p>At midsummer, Wesley spent about three weeks in Oxford.
Here he inquired concerning the exercises requisite in order
to become a Bachelor in Divinity. The Oxford Methodists
were scattered. Out of twenty-five or thirty weekly communicants,
only two were left; and not one continued to attend
the daily prayers of the Church. Here he met with his old
friend, Mr. Gambold, who told him he need be under no
concern respecting his sermon before the university, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
he had come to preach, for the authorities would be utterly
regardless of what he said. Here also he had a conversation
with Richard Viney, originally a London tailor, but now the
Oxford Moravian minister,—a man, as James Hutton tells us,
whose person, delivery, and bearing prevented his sermons
being acceptable to many, and yet a man, who, in this same
year, was elected president of the society in Fetter Lane.
Ultimately he removed to Broad Oaks, Essex, as the superintendent
of the Moravian school; then, by casting lots, was
condemned as an enemy of the work of God; and then joined
Wesley’s society at Birstal, which he so perverted, that they
“laughed at all fasting, and self denial, and family prayer,”
and treated even John Nelson slightingly.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Wesley preached his sermon at St. Mary’s, on Saturday,
July 25, to one of the largest congregations he had seen in
Oxford. His text was: “Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian;” and his two divisions, (1) what is implied in being
<i>almost</i>; and (2) what in being <i>altogether</i>, a Christian. The
sermon is one of the most faithful that Wesley ever preached.
It was printed by W. Strahan, 12mo, pages 21, and was sold
at twopence.</p>

<p>It is almost certain, however, that this was not the sermon
that Wesley <i>meant</i> to preach. After his decease, a mutilated
manuscript in English was found among his papers, dated
“July 24, 1741” (a month before he preached at Oxford), and
also a copy of the same in Latin. This was a discourse on the
text, “How is the faithful city become an harlot!” There can
be no question that the sermon was written with the design of
being delivered before the university, and that, for some reason,
the design for the present was abandoned. The sermon, if
preached, must inevitably have brought upon the preacher
the ire of his hearers. While admitting that the university
had some who were faithful witnesses of gospel truth, Wesley
alleges that, comparatively speaking, they were very few. To
say nothing of deists, Arians, and Socinians, some of the
chief champions of the faith were far from being faultless.
Tillotson had published several sermons expressly to prove
that, not <i>faith alone</i>, but <i>good works</i>, are necessary in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
justification; and the great Bishop Bull had taken the same
position. Wesley then proceeds to attack the members of the
university in a way, perhaps, not the most prudent. He asks
if it is not a fact, that many of them “believe that a good
moral man, and a good Christian, mean the same?” He
continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Scarcely is the form of godliness seen among us. Take any one you
meet; take a second, a third, a fourth, or the twentieth. Not one of them
has even the appearance of a saint, any more than of an angel. Is there
no needless visiting on the sabbath day? no trifling, no impertinence of
conversation? And, on other days, are not the best of our conversing
hours spent in foolish talking and jesting, nay, perhaps, in wanton talking
too? Are there not many among us found to eat and drink with the
drunken? Are not even the hours assigned for study too commonly employed
in reading plays, novels, and idle tales? How many voluntary
blockheads there are among us, whose ignorance is not owing to
incapacity, but to mere laziness! How few, of the vast number, who
have it in their power, are truly learned men! Who is there that can be
said to understand Hebrew? Might I not say, or even Greek? O what
is so scarce as learning, save religion!”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The remainder of this remarkable sermon is in the same
strain. Its allegations, we are afraid, were true; but the
sermon was far too personal to be prudent, and Wesley
exercised a wise discretion in exchanging it for the other.</p>

<p>During the year 1741, while in Wales, Wesley was seized
with a serious illness. Hastening to Bristol, he was ordered,
by Dr. Middleton, to go to bed,—“a strange thing to me,” he
writes, “who have not kept my bed a day for five-and-thirty
years.” A dangerous fever followed, and the Bristol
society held a fast and offered prayer. For eight days, he
hung between life and death; and, for three weeks, he was
kept a prisoner, when, contrary to the advice given him,
he resumed his work, and began to preach daily.</p>

<p>This was a long interval of enforced retirement for a man
of Wesley’s active temperament; but it was not unprofitably
spent. As soon as he could, he began to read, and during his
convalescence devoured half-a-dozen works. He read “the
life of that truly good and great man, Mr. Philip Henry;”
and “the life of Mr. Matthew Henry,—a man not to be de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>spised,
either as a scholar or a Christian, though not equal to
his father.” He read “Mr. Laval’s ‘History of the Reformed
Churches in France;’ full of the most amazing instances of
the wickedness of men, and of the goodness and power of
God.” He likewise read “Turretin’s ‘History of the Church,’
a dry, heavy, barren treatise.” He gave a second perusal to
“Theologia Germanica,” and asks, “O, how was it that I
could ever so admire the affected obscurity of this unscriptural
writer?” He also “read again, with great surprise, part
of the ‘Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius,’” and says, “so
weak, credulous, thoroughly injudicious a writer have I seldom
found.”</p>

<p>Among the pamphlets published against Wesley, during
1741, was one entitled: “The Perfectionists Examined; or,
Inherent Perfection in this Life, no Scripture Doctrine. By
William Fleetwood, Gent.” 8vo, 99 pages. Fleetwood asserts
that, of all the open and professed enemies of the gospel, the
Methodists are the worst; “they are more destructive to
religion than the papists or Mahometans;” “by their artful
insinuations, and outward sanctity, they have drawn numbers
of <i>silly women</i> after them; they plainly show themselves to be
some of those of whom the apostle Peter prophesied, ‘Such
as bring in damnable heresies, denying the Lord that bought
them’”; “and are more like <i>French</i> enthusiasts, or rank
papists, than true Christians.” The reader must guess the
rest.</p>

<p>Another opponent was Joseph Hart, who published a small
work on “The Unreasonableness of Religion, being Remarks
and Animadversions on Mr. John Wesley’s Sermon on
Romans viii. 32.” Of all the enemies Wesley had, Joseph
Hart was one of the most persisting, for he scarcely
ever preached without endeavouring, more or less, to explode
Wesley’s doctrines, as tending to lead the people into
dangerous delusions.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>Another pamphlet, octavo, 75 pages, published during the
year 1741, was entitled: “The Doctrine of Justification by
Faith, stated according to the Articles of the Church of
England. By Arthur Bedford, M.A., Chaplain to His Royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
Highness the Prince of Wales.” This was written at the
request of “a member of the religious societies in London,”
who told the author, that, “there had been great disputes
among them lately concerning this doctrine; some having
advanced faith so high, as to make no necessity of a good
life; and others having advanced works so high, as to make
faith to consist only in a general belief, that the New
Testament is the word of God.” The pamphlet is an able
production, and is temperately written. To most of its sentiments,
Wesley himself would have raised no objection.</p>

<p>It only remains to notice Wesley’s own publications during
1741.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Probably the first was his sermon, entitled, “Christian
Perfection.” He writes: “I think it was in the latter end of
the year 1740, that I had a conversation with Dr. Gibson,
then bishop of London, at Whitehall. He asked me what I
meant by perfection. I told him without any disguise or
reserve. When I ceased speaking, he said, ‘Mr. Wesley, if
this be all you mean, publish it to all the world,’ I answered,
‘My lord, I will’; and accordingly wrote and published the
sermon on Christian perfection.”<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>The two divisions of this important sermon are: (1) in what
sense Christians <i>are not</i>, and (2) in what sense they <i>are</i>,
<i>perfect</i>. Wesley shows that no one is so perfect in this life, as
to be free from ignorance, from mistakes, from infirmities, and
from temptations. On the other hand, he proves that the
perfect Christian is freed from outward sin; from evil
thoughts; and from evil tempers. The sermon is elaborate,
and has affixed to it Charles Wesley’s hymn on “The
Promise of Sanctification,” consisting of twenty-eight stanzas,
and beginning with the line,—“God of all power, and truth,
and grace.”</p>

<p>Another of Wesley’s publications was, “A Collection of
Psalms and Hymns.” Hitherto, all the hymn-books, except
the first, had borne, on the title-page, the names of both the
brothers; but this has the name of Wesley only.</p>

<p>A third was, “A Dialogue between a Predestinarian and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
his Friend.” 12mo, eight pages. The object of this short
tract is to show, from the writings of Piscator, Calvin,
Zanchius, and others, that predestinarianism teaches, that
God causes reprobates to sin, and creates them on purpose
to be damned.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Besides the above, Wesley published four abridgments from
other works.</p>

<p>1. “The Scripture Doctrine concerning Predestination,
Election, and Reprobation.” 12mo, 16 pages.</p>

<p>2. “Serious Considerations on Absolute Predestination.”
12mo, 24 pages. The tract proves, that the doctrine of absolute
predestination is objectionable: (1) because it makes God
the author of sin; (2) because, it makes Him delight in the
death of sinners; (3) because, it is highly injurious to Christ
our Mediator; (4) because, it makes the preaching of the
gospel a mere mock and illusion; etc.</p>

<p>3. “An Extract of the Life of Monsieur De Renty, a late
Nobleman of France.” 12mo, pages 67. De Renty usually
rose at five o’clock; communicated every day; and spent
his time in devotion and doing good. For several years he
ate but one meal a day, and even that was scanty and always
of the poorest food. He often passed the night in a
chair, instead of in bed, or would lie down upon a bench
in his clothes and boots. He parted with several books,
because richly bound; and carried no silver about him,
but for works of charity. When his mother took from
him a large portion of his property, he caused the <i>Te Deum</i>
to be sung, beginning it himself. He was wont to say,
“I carry about with me ordinarily a plenitude of the
presence of the Holy Trinity.” In visiting the sick, he would
kindle their fires, make their beds, and set in order their little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
household stuff. His zeal for the salvation of men was
boundless. “I am ready,” said he, “to serve all men, not
excepting one, and to lay down my life for any one.” He
established numbers of societies at Caen and other places,
for the purpose of Christians assisting one another in
working out both their own and their neighbours’ salvation.
He died at Paris, in the thirty-seventh year of his age, on
April 24, 1649. De Renty was, in Wesley’s estimation, a
model saint.</p>

<p>4. The fourth and last abridgment published, in 1741, was
entitled, “Reflections upon the Conduct of Human Life, with
reference to Learning and Knowledge.” 12mo, pages 36. This
was extracted from a work written by Dr. John Norris, an
old friend of Wesley’s father, and one of the principal contributors
to the <i>Athenian Gazette</i>.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>The tract, throughout, is in a high degree rich and racy,
and well worth reading. It unquestionably contains the
great principles which guided Wesley in all his reading,
writing, publishing of books, and educational efforts in
general. He considered all kinds of knowledge useful; but,
some being much more so than others, he devoted to them
time and attention accordingly; and made the whole subordinate
to the great purpose of human existence,—the glory of
God, and the happiness of man. We finish the present
chapter with a few sentences culled from the conclusion
of this threepenny production:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot, with any patience, reflect, that, out of so short a time as
human life, consisting, it may be, of fifty or sixty years, nineteen or twenty
shall be spent in hammering out a little Latin and Greek, and in learning
a company of poetical fictions and fantastic stories. If one were to judge
of the life of man by the proportion of it spent at school, one would think
the antediluvian mark were not yet out. Besides, the things taught in
seminaries are often frivolous. How many excellent and useful things
might be learnt, while boys are thumbing and murdering Hesiod and
Homer? Of what signification is such stuff as this, to the accomplishment
of a reasonable soul? What improvement can it be to my understanding,
to know the amours of <i>Pyramus</i> and <i>Thisbe</i>, or of <i>Hero</i> and
<i>Leander</i>? Let any man but consider human nature, and tell me
whether he thinks a boy is fit to be trusted with Ovid? And yet, to
books such as these our youth is dedicated, and in these some of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
employ our riper years; and, when we die, this makes one part of our
funeral eulogy; though, according to the principles before laid down, we
should have been as pertinently and more innocently employed all the
while, if we had been picking straws in Bedlam. The measure of prosecuting
learning is its usefulness to good life; and, consequently, all prosecution
of it beyond or beside this end, is impertinent and immoderate.
For my own part, I am so thoroughly convinced of the certainty of the
principles here propounded, that I look upon myself as under almost a
necessity of conducting my studies by them, and intend to study nothing
at all but what serves to the advancement of piety and good life. I have
spent about thirteen years in the most celebrated university in the world,
in pursuing both such learning as the academical standard requires, and
as my private genius inclined me to; but I intend to spend my uncertain
remainder of time in studying only what makes for the moral improvement
of my mind, and the regulation of my life. More particularly,
I shall apply myself to read such books as are rather persuasive than instructive;
such as warm, kindle, and enlarge the affections, and awaken
the Divine sense in the soul; being convinced, by every day’s experience,
that I have more need of heat than light; though were I for more light,
still I think the love of God is the best light of the soul of man.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is a long extract; but it is of some consequence, as
furnishing a key to the whole of Wesley’s literary pursuits—from
this, the commencement of his Methodist career, to the
end of his protracted life. His aim was not to shine in
scholarship, but to live a life of goodness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742<br />

Age  39</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WESLEY now began to enlarge the sphere of his
operations. Hitherto, his only stated congregations
had been at Kingswood, at Bristol, and at the Foundery,
London. For these, the ministrations of himself and his
brother were sufficient; but, as the work increased, new
preachers became needful. Cennick and Humphreys had both
left him; but others supplied their places. John Nelson came
to London, was converted, and, at the end of the year 1740,
returned to Birstal in Yorkshire, where, impelled by the love
of Christ, and almost without knowing it, he began to preach
to his unconverted neighbours. Thomas Maxfield also, one
of the first converts in Bristol, and who, for a year or two,
seems to have travelled with Charles Wesley, perhaps in the
capacity of servant, being left in London, to meet during
Wesley’s absence the Foundery society, pray with them, and
give them suitable advice, was insensibly led from praying
to preaching,—his sermons being accompanied with such
power, that numbers were made penitent and were converted.
Wesley, hearing of this irregularity, hurried back to London,
for the purpose of stopping it. His mother, living in his
house, adjoining the Foundery, said: “John, take care what
you do with respect to that young man, for he is as surely
called of God to preach, as you are. Examine what have
been the fruits of his preaching, and hear him yourself.” The
Countess of Huntingdon also wrote: “Maxfield is one of the
greatest instances of God’s peculiar favour that I know. He
is my astonishment. The first time I made him expound, I
expected little from him; but, before he had gone over
one fifth part of his discourse, my attention was riveted,
and I was immovable. His power in prayer, also, is very
extraordinary.”<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>Wesley was convinced, and the Rubicon was passed. “I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
not clear,” he writes under the date of April 21, 1741, “that
brother Maxfield should not expound at Greyhound Lane;
nor can I as yet do without him. Our clergymen” (Stonehouse,
Hall, and others) “have miscarried full as much as the
laymen; and that the Moravians are other than laymen, I
know not.”<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Wesley wrote again, about four years after
employing Maxfield:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am bold to affirm, that these unlettered men have help from God
for the great work of saving souls from death. But, indeed, in the one
thing which they profess to know, they are not ignorant men. I trust
there is not one of them, who is not able to go through such an examination,
in substantial, practical, experimental divinity, as few of our
candidates for holy orders, even in the university, are able to do. In
answer to the objection, that they are laymen, I reply, the scribes of
old, who were the ordinary preachers among the Jews, were not priests;
they were not better than laymen. Yea, many of them were incapable
of the priesthood, being not of the tribe of Levi. Hence, probably, it
was, that the Jews themselves never urged it as an objection to our Lord’s
preaching, that He was no priest after the order of Aaron; nor, indeed,
could be; seeing He was of the tribe of Judah. Nor does it appear
that any objected this to the apostles. If we come to later times, was
Mr. Calvin ordained? Was he either priest or deacon? And were not
most of those whom it pleased God to employ in promoting the Reformation
abroad, laymen also? Could that great work have been promoted
at all, in many places, if laymen had not preached? In all Protestant
churches, ordination is not held a necessary pre-requisite of preaching;
for in Sweden, in Germany, in Holland, and, I believe, in every Reformed
church in Europe, it is not only permitted, but required, that, before any
one is ordained, he shall publicly preach a year or more <i>ad probandum
facultatem</i>. And, for this practice, they believe they have an express
command of God; ‘let those first be proved, then let them use the office
of a deacon, being found blameless’ (1 Tim. iii. 10). Besides, in how
many churches, in England, does the parish clerk read one of the lessons,
and in some the whole service of the Church, perhaps every Lord’s day?
And do not other laymen constantly do the same thing in our very
cathedrals? which, being under the inspection of the bishops, should be
patterns to all other churches. Nay, is it not done in the universities
themselves? Who ordained that singing man at Christ Church; who
is likewise utterly unqualified for the work, murdering every lesson he
reads; not endeavouring to read it as the word of God, but rather as
an old song?”</p>
</div>

<p>Where is the priest, pretending that preaching belongs exclusively
to those in orders, who can answer such arguments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
as these? But Wesley’s case was stronger than even this. He
proceeds to relate that, after God had used him and his
brother clergymen, in several places, in turning many from a
course of sin to a course of holiness, the ministers of these
places, instead of receiving them with open arms, spoke of
them “as if the devil, not God, had sent them; and represented
them as fellows not fit to live,—papists, heretics,
traitors, conspirators against their king and country;” while
the people, who had been converted by their preaching, were
“driven from the Lord’s table, and were openly cursed in
the name of God.” What could be done in a case like
this? “No clergyman would assist at all. The expedient
that remained was, to find some one among themselves,
who was upright of heart, and of sound judgment in
the things of God; and to desire him to meet the rest as
often as he could, in order to confirm, as he was able, in
the ways of God, either by reading to them, or by prayer,
or by exhortation.”</p>

<p>This was done, and God blessed it. “In several places, by
means of these unlettered men, not only those who had
already begun to run well were hindered from drawing back
to perdition; but other sinners also, from time to time, were
converted from the error of their ways.”</p>

<p>“This plain account,” continues Wesley, “of the whole
proceeding, I take to be the best defence of it. I know no
scripture which forbids making use of such help, in a case of
such necessity. And I praise God who has given even this
help to those poor sheep, when ‘their own shepherds pitied
them not.’”</p>

<p>Brave-hearted Wesley! The step he took was momentous;
but he was a match for all opposers; and marvellous is the
fact that the very Church, which so branded him for such a
departure from Church order, is now actually copying his
example. Notable, in future years, will be the incident, which
has almost passed without being noticed, that, in the month
of May, 1869, in his own private chapel, at London House,
Dr. Jackson, Bishop of London, formally authorised eight
laymen “to read prayers, and to read and <i>explain</i> the Holy
Scriptures,” and “to conduct religious services for the poor in
schools, and mission rooms, and in the open air,” in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
London diocese, with the understanding and agreement that
their labours will be rendered gratuitously.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Thus are even
bishops treading in the once hated footsteps of the great
Methodist.</p>

<p>In 1742, Wesley’s itinerating commenced in earnest.
During the year, he spent about twenty-four weeks in London
and its vicinity; fourteen in Bristol and the surrounding
neighbourhood; one in Wales; and thirteen in making two
tours to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, taking, on his way, Donnington
Park, Birstal, Halifax, Dewsbury, Mirfield, Epworth,
Sheffield, and other towns and villages adjoining these.</p>

<p>Whitefield spent the first two months in Bristol, Gloucester,
and the west of England, and the three following in London.
He then went to Scotland, where he continued until the end
of October, when he returned to London for the remainder of
the year.</p>

<p>Wesley and he were again friends. On April 23, Wesley
writes: “I spent an agreeable hour with Mr. Whitefield. I
believe he is sincere in all he says, concerning his earnest
desire of joining hand in hand with all that love the Lord
Jesus Christ. But if, as some would persuade me, he is not,
the loss is all on his own side. I am just as I was. I go on
my way, whether he goes with me or stays behind.”</p>

<p>This interview took place at Easter, a season of the year
which Moorfields was wont to keep with uproarious hilarity.
On this occasion, the spacious rendezvous was filled, from end
to end, with mountebanks, players, drummers, trumpeters,
merryandrews, and menageries. Whitefield mounted his field
pulpit, and from twenty to thirty thousand people flocked
around him. He became a target, at which were hurled dirt,
dead cats, stones, and rotten eggs. A fool belonging to one
of the puppetshows attempted to lash him with a whip; and
a recruiting sergeant, with his drum and other musical instruments,
marched through his congregation; but Whitefield,
for three hours, continued praying, preaching, and singing;
and then retired to the Tabernacle, with his pocket full of
notes from persons who had been awakened by his sermon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
and which were read amid the praises and acclamations of
assembled crowds. A thousand such papers had been sent to
him; and three hundred and fifty of the inquiring penitents
were received into church fellowship in a single day.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>Wesley and Whitefield henceforth were divided, and yet
united. Each pursued his own separate course; but their
hearts were one. Their creeds were different; but not their
aims. “Mr. Wesley,” writes Whitefield in 1742, “I think is
wrong in some things; but I believe he will shine bright in
glory. I have not given way to him, or to any, whom I thought
in error, no not for an hour; but I think it best not to dispute,
where there is no probability of convincing.”<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> And again, in
a letter to Wesley himself, on October 11, 1742, he says:
“I had your kind letter, dated October 5. In answer to the
first part of it, I say, ‘Let old things pass away, and all things
become new.’ I can also heartily say ‘Amen’ to the latter
part of it—‘Let the king live for ever and controversy die,’
It has died with me long ago. I thank you, dear sir, for
praying for me. I have been upon my knees praying for
you and yours, and that nothing but love, lowliness, and
simplicity may be among us!”<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>To the day of his death, Whitefield breathed this loving
spirit, and rejoiced to find reciprocal affection in his friend
Wesley. After this, we shall refrain from adverting to his
history more than we find needful,—not for want of admiration
of his character and labours, but because it is impossible, in
casual notices, to do him justice. He was still hounded as
much as ever by the dogs of persecution. Though he was
now in Scotland, where, if anywhere, his Calvinistic doctrines
were likely to gain him favour, yet even there he met with
virulent opposers. Among other extremely bitter pamphlets
published against him, in 1742, was one printed at Edinburgh,
“by a true lover of the Church and country,” who represented
him as taking upon himself “the office of a thirteenth apostle,”
and concluded his courteous outpouring thus: “Let all good
people beware of this stroller, for he will yet find a way to
wheedle you out of your money. He is as artful a mounte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>bank
as any I know.” Another pamphlet, entitled “The
Declaration of the True Presbyterians, within the Kingdom
of Scotland, concerning Mr. George Whitefield and the work
at Cambuslang,” begun as follows:—“The declaration, protestation,
and testimony of the suffering remnant of the anti-popish,
anti-Lutheran, anti-prelatic, anti-Whitefieldian, anti-Erastian,
anti-sectarian, true Presbyterian church of Christ in
Scotland;” and then this windy performance, of thirty-two
pages, proceeds to say that Whitefield is “an abjured, prelatic
hireling, of as lax toleration principles as any that ever set up
for the advancing the kingdom of Satan. He is a wandering
star, who steers his course according to the compass of gain
and advantage.” A third publication, issued in 1742, was, “A
Warning against countenancing the ministrations of Mr.
George Whitefield, wherein is shown that Mr. Whitefield is no
minister of Jesus Christ; that his call and coming to Scotland
are scandalous; that his practice is disorderly and fertile of
disorder; and that his whole doctrine is, and his success
must be, diabolical. By Adam Gib, minister of the gospel at
Edinburgh.” In this sweet effusion of seventy-five pages,
poor Whitefield is solemnly pronounced to be “one of those
false Christs, of whom the church is forewarned, Matt. xxiv.
24.” After reviewing some of Whitefield’s tenets, Mr. Adam
Gib deliciously remarks: “in raking through this dunghill of
Mr. Whitefield’s doctrine, we have raised as much <i>stink</i> as
will suffocate all his followers, that shall venture to draw near
without stopping their noses.” “The complex scheme of his
doctrine is diabolical; it proceeds through diabolical influence,
and is applied unto a diabolical use, against the Mediator’s
glory and the salvation of men.” This was pretty strong for
a young man, twenty-nine years of age, and who, four years
afterwards, became the leader of the party known by the
name of Anti-burghers. We are prepared, by such pious
venom, for the fact, that, in the year following, when the
“associate presbytery met for renewing the national covenant
of Scotland, and the solemn league and covenant of
the three nations,” they drew up and printed “a confession
of the sins of the ministry,” in which they humble themselves
before God, for not “timeously” warning the people against
Whitefield; for being “too remiss in their endeavours to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
prevent the sad effects of his ministrations;” for being
“too little affected by the latitudinarian principles and awful
delusions which he had propagated;” and for not “crying
to God, that He would rebuke the devourer, and cast the
false prophet and the unclean spirit out of the land.”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Despite all this, Whitefield cheerily pursued the path
marked out by Providence. Few men have been more entitled
to the last beatitude in our Saviour’s sermon, “Blessed
are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My
sake.”</p>

<p>It was through the timely interposition of Howel Harris,
that the friendship between Wesley and Whitefield was resumed.
Towards this warm-hearted Welshman Wesley
cherished the most sincere affection, and, on the 6th of
August, 1742, wrote to him as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—I have just read yours, dated at Trevecca,
October 19, 1741. And what is it that we contend about? Allow such a
perfection as you have there described, and all further dispute I account
vain jangling and mere strife of words. As to the other point, we agree:
(1) that no man can have any power except it be given him from above;
(2) that no man can merit anything but hell, seeing all other merit is in
the blood of the Lamb. For those two fundamental points, both you and
I earnestly contend; what need, then, of this great gulf to be fixed between
us? Brother, is thy heart with mine, as my heart is with thine?
If it be, give me thy hand. I am indeed a poor, foolish, sinful worm; and
how long my Lord will use me, I know not. I sometimes think the time
is coming when He will lay me aside. For surely never before did He
send such a labourer into such a harvest. But, so long as I am continued
in the work, let us rise up together against the evil-doers; let us not
weaken, but strengthen one another’s hands in God. My brother, my
soul is gone forth to meet thee; let us fall upon one another’s neck. The
good Lord blot out all that is past, and let there henceforward be peace
between me and thee!</p>

<p class="psig">
“I am, my dear brother, ever yours,<br />
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Another of Wesley’s friends, at this period, was the Rev.
Henry Piers, vicar of Bexley, a devoted man, who, through
the instrumentality of Charles Wesley and Mr. Bray, had found
peace with God on the 10th of June, 1738. He at once began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
to preach, with great fidelity, the scriptural method of salvation;
and such was his success, that in August, 1739,
Whitefield assisted him in administering the sacrament, in
Bexley church, to nearly six hundred communicants.
Keziah Wesley was an inmate of his house; and Wesley
himself was a welcome visitor. He was one of the six
persons who composed Wesley’s first Conference, in 1744;
and one of the three who publicly walked with Wesley from
the church of St. Mary’s, Oxford, when he preached, for the
last time, before the university.</p>

<p>In 1742, the vicar of Bexley was appointed to preach at
Sevenoaks, “before the right worshipful the Dean of the
Arches, and the reverend the clergy of the deanery of
Shoreham, assembled in visitation.” The text chosen by Mr.
Piers was 1 Corinthians iv. 1, 2; and his object was to show
what doctrines ministers ought to preach, and also what ought
to be their tempers and behaviour. A letter to Wesley,
written May 24, three days after the sermon was delivered,
states that, at the beginning of his discourse, Piers was
listened to with gravity; but, while dwelling upon the doctrines
of the Church, his reverend auditors began to indulge
in “shrewd looks and indignant smiles”; this was followed
with “laughter and loud whispers,” some of them saying,
“Piers is mad, crazy, and a fool.” When he came to the
application of his discourse, and asked whether the clergy
preached such doctrines, possessed such tempers, and led such
lives, the ordinary would endure it no longer, but beckoned
to the apparitor to open his pew door, and to the minister of
Sevenoaks church to command Piers to stop. The minister
made a sign to the preacher, but without effect. The ordinary
then publicly desired Piers to pronounce the benediction,
as the congregation had already heard quite enough.
Piers, however, still went on; all the clergy, except one or
two, walked out; and the preacher, without further interruption,
finished his discourse to an attentive audience.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The sermon, though written by Mr. Piers, was, previous to
its being preached, revised by Wesley;<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> and, in September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
ensuing, was published, price sixpence,<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> with a list of the
books sold by Wesley at the Foundery in Moorfields, inserted.
The sermon, in point of fact, was a joint production of Wesley
and his friend. Any one, comparing it with other sermons
published by Mr. Piers, will perceive an unmistakable difference
in style, and force of expression. The sermon was, to a
great extent, Wesley’s; and, in this instance, Wesley was
almost preaching by proxy.</p>

<p>Wesley longed for helpers; but, conscious that none would
be useful unless converted, he was careful in accepting offers.
Of his friend Piers he could have no doubt; but it was otherwise
with respect to a clergyman from America, who called
upon him at the beginning of the year, and “appeared full of
good desires.” Wesley writes: “I cannot suddenly answer
in this matter; I must first know what spirit he is of; for
none can labour with us, unless he ‘count all things dung and
dross, that he may win Christ.’” With Wesley, neither learning,
nor talent, nor even orders, nor all combined, were sufficient
to induce him to accept a helper, unless there was also
piety. Purity in preachers is of more importance than either
scholarship, or genius, or both united. The former is an
essential, without which no man ought to preach; the latter
are, at the best, but useful in helping a preacher to preach
successfully.</p>

<p>In a certain sense, Methodist societies were begun in 1739;
but it was not until 1742 that they were divided into classes.
In January, 1739, the London society, which was really Moravian,
and not Methodist, consisted of about sixty persons.
Three months after that, Wesley went to Bristol, where “a
few persons agreed to meet weekly, with the same intention as
those in London”; and these were soon increased by “several
little societies, which were already meeting in divers parts
of the city,” amalgamating with them. About the same time
similar societies were formed at Kingswood and at Bath.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
These religious communities grew and multiplied. At the
beginning of 1742, the London society alone, after repeated
siftings, numbered about eleven hundred members.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Hitherto,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
Wesley and his brother had been their only pastors; but, on
February 15, 1742, an accident led to a momentous alteration.
Nearly three years before, Wesley had built his meeting-house
in Bristol; but, notwithstanding the subscriptions and collections
made at the time to defray the expense, a large debt
was still unpaid. On the day mentioned, some of the principal
members of the Bristol society met together to consult
how their pecuniary obligations should be discharged. One
of them stood up and said, “Let every member of the society
give a penny a week, till the debt is paid.” Another answered,
“Many of them are poor, and cannot afford to do it.”
“Then,” said the former, “put eleven of the poorest with me;
and if they can give anything, well; I will call on them
weekly; and if they can give nothing, I will give for them as
well as for myself. And each of you call on eleven of your
neighbours weekly; receive what they give, and make up
what is wanting.” “It was done,” writes Wesley; “and in
a while, some of these informed me, they found such and
such an one did not live as he ought. It struck me immediately,
‘This is the thing, the very thing, we have wanted
so long.’”</p>

<p>What was the result? Wesley called together these weekly
collectors of money to pay the debt on the Bristol chapel,
and desired each, in addition to collecting money, to make
particular inquiry into the behaviour of the members whom
they visited. They did so. Many disorderly walkers were
detected; and thus the society was purged of unworthy
members.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Within six weeks after this, on March 25, Wesley introduced
the same plan in London; where he had long found it
difficult to become acquainted with all the members personally.
He requested “several earnest and sensible men to meet
him,” to whom he explained his difficulty. They all agreed
that, “to come to a sure, thorough knowledge of each member,
there could be no better way than to divide the society into
classes, like those at Bristol.” Wesley, at once, appointed,
as leaders, “those in whom he could most confide”; and thus,
after an existence of three years, the Methodist societies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
divided into classes, in 1742. “This,” says Wesley, “was the
origin of our classes, for which I can never sufficiently praise
God; the unspeakable usefulness of the institution having
ever since been more and more manifest.”<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>At first, the leaders visited each member at his own house;
but this was soon found to be inconvenient. It required more
time than the leaders had to spare; and many members lived
with masters, mistresses, or relations, where it was almost
impossible for such visits to be made. Hence, before long, it
was agreed, that each leader should meet his apportioned
members all together, once a week, at a time and place most
convenient for the whole. The leader began and ended each
meeting with singing and prayer, and spent about an hour in
conversing with those present, one by one.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>Thus class-meetings began. Wesley writes, “It can scarce
be conceived what advantages have been reaped by this little
prudential regulation. Many now experienced that Christian
fellowship, of which they had not so much as an idea before.
They began to bear one another’s burdens, and naturally to
care for each other’s welfare. And as they had daily a more
intimate acquaintance, so they had a more endeared affection
for each other. Upon reflection, I could not but observe, this
is the very thing which was from the beginning of Christianity.
As soon as any Jews or heathen were so convinced of the
truth, as to forsake sin, and seek the gospel of salvation, the
first preachers immediately joined them together; took an
account of their names; advised them to watch over each
other; and met these κατηχουμενοι, <i>catechumens</i>, as they were
then called, apart from the great congregation, that they
might instruct, rebuke, exhort, and pray with them, and for
them, according to their several necessities.”<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Such is Wesley’s own account of the origin of these weekly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
meetings. Some of the old members were, at first, extremely
averse to this new arrangement, regarding it, not as a privilege,
but rather a restraint. They objected, that there were
no such meetings when they joined the society, and asked
why such meetings should be instituted now. To this Wesley
answered, that he regarded class-meetings not essential, nor
of Divine institution, but merely prudential helps, which it
was a pity the society had not been favoured with from the
beginning. “We are always open to instruction,” says he
to these complainants, “willing to be wiser every day than we
were before, and to change whatever we can change for the
better.”</p>

<p>Another objection was, “There is no scripture for classes.”
Wesley replied, that there was no scripture against them;
and that, in point of fact, there was much scripture for them,
namely, texts which enjoined the substance of the thing,
leaving indifferent circumstances to be determined by reason
and experience.</p>

<p>The most plausible objection of all, however, was that
which is often urged at the present day. Wesley writes:
“They spoke far more plausibly who said, ‘The thing is well
enough in itself; but the leaders have neither gifts nor graces
for such an employment.’ I answer—(1) Yet such leaders as
they are, it is plain God has blessed their labour. (2) If any
of these is remarkably wanting in gifts or grace, he is soon
taken notice of and removed. (3) If you know any such, tell
it to me, not to others, and I will endeavour to exchange him
for a better. (4) It may be hoped they will all be better than
they are, both by experience and observation, and by the
advices given them by the minister every Tuesday night, and
the prayers (then in particular) offered up for them.”<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>The appointment of these leaders was of vast importance;
but it was not sufficient. Wesley continues: “As the society
increased, I found it required still greater care to separate the
precious from the vile. In order to this, I determined, at
least once in every three months, to talk with every member
myself, and to inquire at their own mouths, whether they
grew in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
At these seasons, I likewise particularly inquire whether there
be any misunderstanding or difference among them; that
every hindrance of peace and brotherly love may be taken
out of the way.”<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>Nothing need be added to this full account of the origin of
the class-meeting and the quarterly visitation of the Methodists.
Wesley, from the beginning, “recognised the scriptural
distinction between the church and the world. The men who
possessed religion, and the men who possessed it not, were
not for a moment confounded. They might be neighbours in
locality, and friends in goodwill; but they were wide as the
poles asunder in sentiment. The quick and the dead may
be placed side by side; but no one can, for ever so short a
period, mistake dead flesh for living fibre. The church and
the churchyard are close by; but the worshippers in the one
and the dwellers in the other are as unlike as two worlds can
make them. The circle within the circle, the company of the
converted, Wesley always distinguished from the mass of
mankind, and made special provision for their edification in
all his organisms.”<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>After the formation of classes, the next event in point of
importance, in the year 1742, was Wesley’s visit to the north
of England. A combination of circumstances led to this.</p>

<p>John Nelson had been converted among the Methodists in
London, and had returned to Birstal, in Yorkshire, where
Benjamin Ingham had already founded a number of flourishing
Moravian brotherhoods. Nelson began to preach in the
towns of Yorkshire; his labours were greatly blessed; and
many of the greatest profligates, blasphemers, drunkards, and
sabbath-breakers were entirely changed. John had often
invited Wesley to visit Yorkshire, and this was one of the
reasons of his setting out.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Another was, that the Countess of Huntingdon had earnestly
urged him to proceed to Newcastle, and to employ his
best efforts to improve the moral and religious condition of
the colliers on the Tyne. The letter, containing this request,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
has not been published, but is in the possession of the Rev.
James Everett.</p>

<p>The countess was now resident at Donnington Park, the
favourite home of her noble husband, the Earl of Huntingdon,
who, like herself, treated ministers of Christ with every mark
of polite attention. His sisters, Lady Betty Hastings, and
Lady Margaret, (who afterwards became the wife of Ingham,)
had been converted through the instrumentality of the
Methodists, and were now sincere and earnest Christians.
Donnington became a sort of rallying place for Christian
ministers and Christian people. Mr. Simpson and Mr. Graves,
two converted clergymen, resided in the neighbourhood. David
Taylor, one of the servants of the Earl of Huntingdon, had
commenced preaching in the surrounding hamlets and villages,
and had begun a work which resulted in the forming of the
New Connexion of General Baptists. Miss Fanny Cooper,
residing with the countess, and dying of consumption, was
greatly beloved by Wesley, and wished to see him.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> All these
circumstances had to do with his setting out for the midland
counties, for Yorkshire, and for Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>

<p>On the 9th of January, Lady Huntingdon wrote to him,
saying, that Miss Cooper was waiting for the consolation of
Israel with an indescribable firmness of faith and hope. She
had read his Journal, which he had sent for her perusal, and
thought there was nothing in it which ought to be left out;
and that the manner in which he spoke of himself could not
be mended.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>In another letter, dated the 15th of March, she tells him
that she is sure he is a chosen vessel set for the defence of the
gospel; that she has given up the school at Markfield; that
John Taylor is gone to be an assistant to David Taylor, and
to become a schoolmaster among the people who had been
converted; and that Mr. Graves had been blessed by Wesley’s
conversation, and greatly loved him.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>In a third letter, dated ten days later, Wesley is informed
that John Taylor is about to wait upon him, and to say that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
unless David Taylor (who had contracted an ill judged
marriage, and fallen into the German stillness) transferred his
flock to Wesley and his brother Charles, the countess would
withdraw from him her support and countenance. She adds:
“I would not trust David with the guidance of my soul, no,
not for worlds. I find he is going to build himself a room,
and to break with the ministers, and become a lay preacher.
He has more pride than I ever saw in man. If he will
commit his poor sheep into your hands, I will assist in the
room, school, etc.; but else will I do nothing. You are much
mistaken about the bishops not reading what you publish; I
know they do. Let me know in your next if you approve
what I have done about David.”<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>Six weeks afterwards, Lady Huntingdon wrote again,
saying that Miss Cooper was at the point of death, and
wished to see Wesley; and that a horse had been ordered for
John Taylor to go down with him.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> On receiving this,
Wesley started almost immediately. He reached Donnington
Park on May 22; found Miss Cooper just alive; spent three
days with her and the countess, rejoicing in the grace of God;
and then set out for Birstal, still accompanied by John
Taylor.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> On arriving at Birstal, Wesley went to an inn and
sent for John Nelson; and John came and carried him to
his own humble home. Thus was the aristocratic mansion
exchanged for the mason’s cottage. Numbers had been
converted by John’s plain, blunt preaching; but, because he
advised them to go to church and sacrament, Ingham reproved
him, and forbade the members of his societies to
hear him.</p>

<p>Ingham, to some extent at least, had fallen into the
dangerous delusions of the Moravians. He had also exposed
himself to suspicions of another kind. Dr. Doddridge, in a
letter written a fortnight before Wesley’s visit to Birstal, says:
“I am much surprised with a book, called the ‘Country
Parson’s Advice to a Parishioner,’ which is circulated, with
extreme diligence, by Ingham, and other Methodists in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
part of the country. It artfully disguises, but most evidently
contains and recommends, almost all the doctrines of popery,
and none more than that fatal one of consigning conscience
and fortune into the hands of the priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> I am not
hasty to smell out a Jesuit, and ever thought the Methodists
had more honesty than wisdom; but this certain fact surprises
me, and I should be glad of a key to it. It may be said, that
they have generally appeared men of plain understandings,
void of that art and learning necessary for missionaries; but all
plots require tools, and have underparts, nor may these always
be let into the whole design. On the whole, while they are
diffusing such sentiments, Protestantism and our free constitution
may have as little reason to thank them as learning
and reason have already.”<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Wesley preached, on May 26, at noon, on the top of Birstal
hill; spent the afternoon in conversing with Nelson’s converts;
and, at eight at night, preached on Dewsbury moor,
two miles from Birstal, and, in opposition to the Moravian
tenets, “earnestly exhorted all who believed, to wait upon
God in His ways, and to let their light shine before men.”</p>

<p>His labours were not without success. One of his hearers
was Nathaniel Harrison, a young man twenty-three years of
age, who soon after was made circuit steward, an office which
he filled for more than twenty years, and during a long life
encountered no small amount of brutal persecution for the
sake of his great Master. His father turned him out of
doors; his eldest brother horsewhipped him; and the mob
hurled missiles at his head, and, on one occasion, were
literally bespattered with his blood. Nathaniel Harrison
was a happy Christian, and attained to the age of eighty
years before he died; he was wont to say, “My soul is
always on the wing, I only wait the summons.”<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span></p>

<p>Another of Wesley’s hearers was John Murgatroyd, a
weaver, who became a member of the second class which was
formed in Yorkshire; was present when John Nelson was
pressed for a soldier; and was one of those brave-hearted
Methodists who sang songs of praise at the door of Nelson’s
prison. He lived to have ten children, fifty-one grandchildren,
and twenty-one great grandchildren; and, after being sixty-three
years a Methodist, he peacefully breathed his last
breath at Wansford, in the east of Yorkshire, having, on the
day before, attended three public services, and sung the
praises of his Saviour with an animation which seemed to
evince that he was exulting in the hope of singing the new
song in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Leaving Birstal, Wesley and John Taylor came to Newcastle
on Friday, May 28.</p>

<p>This northern metropolis was then widely different to what
it is at present. Then the only streets, of any consequence,
were Pilgrim Street, Newgate Street, Westgate Street, the
Side, and Sandgate. On the south of Westgate Street there
was nothing but open country. Between Westgate Street
and Newgate Street, the only buildings were the vicarage and
St. John’s church; whilst between Newgate Street and the
upper part of Pilgrim Street almost the only edifice was the
house of the Franciscan Friars. On the east of Pilgrim
Street were open fields, and on the north nothing but a few
straggling houses. The town was surrounded with a wall,
having turrets, towers, and gates. On what is now the centre
of the town, stood the princely dwelling of Sir William
Blackett, environed with extensive pleasure grounds, adorned
with trees and statues. There were five churches: St. John’s,
in which, besides the Sunday services, there were public
prayers three times every week; St. Andrew’s, where, in
addition to services on sabbaths, prayers were read every
Wednesday and Friday morning; Allhallows; St. Nicholas’s,
in which there was public service twice daily; and the church
of St. Thomas, at the entrance of the street on Newcastle
bridge. The Roman Catholics had a chapel at the Nuns; the
Quakers a meeting-house in Pilgrim Street, nearly opposite to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
the Pilgrim’s Inn; and the Dissenters two or three chapels in
different parts, and also a burial ground near Ballast Hills.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>As already stated, Wesley reached Newcastle on Friday
night, the 28th of May. The public house, in which he lodged,
belonged to a Mr. Gun, and stood a few yards northward of
the site on which he built his Orphan House. This, at
the time, was open country, and about a mile from busy,
dirty, degraded Sandgate on the river side. On walking out,
after tea, he was surprised and shocked at the abounding
wickedness. Drunkenness and swearing seemed general, and
even the mouths of little children were full of curses. How
he spent the Saturday we are not informed; but, on Sunday
morning, at seven,<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> he and John Taylor took their stand, near
the pump, in Sandgate, “the poorest and most contemptible
part of the town,” and began to sing the old hundredth psalm
and tune. Three or four people came about them, “to see
what was the matter;” these soon increased in number, and,
before Wesley finished preaching, his congregation consisted
of from twelve to fifteen hundred persons. When the service
was ended, the people still “stood gaping, with the most profound
astonishment,” upon which Wesley said: “If you desire
to know who I am, my name is John Wesley. At five in the
evening, with God’s help, I design to preach here again.”</p>

<p>Such was the commencement of Methodism in the north of
England,—the preacher the renowned John Wesley, doubtless
dressed in full canonicals, with plain John Taylor standing at
his side,—the time seven o’clock on a Sunday morning, in the
beautiful month of May,—the place Sandgate, crowded with
keelmen and sailors, using, says Christopher Hopper, “the
language of hell, as though they had received a liberal
education in the regions of woe,”<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>—the song of praise the
old hundredth psalm, which, like the grand old ocean, is as
fresh and as full of music now as it was when it first was
written,—and the text, the very pith of gospel truth, “He
was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our
iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and
with His stripes we are healed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span></p>

<p>Strict churchman as he was, there can be but little doubt,
that Wesley and his companion attended the morning and
afternoon services in some of the Newcastle churches; but
at five o’clock, amid balmy breezes, he again took his stand
on the hill, by the side of the Keelman’s Hospital. On one
hand was the town with the fine old wall, fortified with towers;
on the other hand were fields, stretching away to Ouseburn
and Byker; behind him was the open country, dotted here
and there with fragrant gardens, Jesus’s Hospital, the workhouse,
the charity school of Allhallows church, and Pandon
Hall, formerly the residence of the Northumbrian kings;
while just before him were the swarming hordes of Sandgate,
the crowded quay, and the river Tyne. The hill was covered
from its summit to its base. In Moorfields and on Kennington
Common, he had preached to congregations numbering
from ten to twenty thousand people; but his congregation
here was the largest he had ever seen. “After preaching,” he
writes, “the poor people were ready to tread me under foot,
out of pure love and kindness.” With difficulty, he reached
his inn, where he found several of his hearers waiting his
arrival. They told him they were members of a religious
society, which had existed for many years, had a “fine
library,” and whose “steward read a sermon every Sunday.”
They urged him to remain with them, at least, a few days
longer; but, having promised to be at Birstal on Tuesday
night, he was unable to consent. Accordingly, rising even
before the sun on Monday morning, he set out at three
o’clock, rode about eighty miles, and lodged at night at
Boroughbridge. The next day, he came to Birstal, holding a
prayer-meeting at Knaresborough on the way; and at night,
surrounded by a vast multitude, conducted a religious service
of two hours and a half duration. In Birstal and its neighbourhood,
he spent the next three days, preaching at Mrs.
Holmes’s, near Halifax, at Dewsbury Moor, at Mirfield, and
at Adwalton.</p>

<p>He then set out for Epworth, and went to an inn, where an
old servant of his father’s and two or three poor women found
him. The next day being Sunday, he offered to assist Mr.
Romley, the curate, either by preaching or reading prayers;
but his offer was declined, and a sermon was offensively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
preached by Romley against enthusiasts. After the service,
John Taylor gave notice, as the people were coming out, that
Mr. Wesley, not being permitted to preach in the church,
designed to preach in the churchyard, at six o’clock. Accordingly,
at that hour, he stood on his father’s tombstone, and
preached to the largest congregation Epworth had ever witnessed.
The scene was unique and inspiriting,—a living son
preaching on a dead father’s grave, because the parish priest
refused to allow him to officiate in a dead father’s church.
“I am well assured,” writes Wesley, “that I did far more
good to my Lincolnshire parishioners by preaching three
days on my father’s tomb, than I did by preaching three
years in his pulpit.”<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>Contrary to his intention, he remained eight days at
Epworth, and every night used his father’s tombstone as his
rostrum. He also preached at Burnham, Ouston, Belton, Overthorp,
and Haxey. Here religious societies had been formed;
but two men, John Harrison and Richard Ridley, had poisoned
them with the Moravian heresy, telling them that “all the
ordinances are man’s inventions, and that if they went to
church or sacrament, they would be damned.” One of them,
at Belton, who once ran well, now said “he saw the devil in
every corner of the church, and in the face of every one who
went to it.” Still, a great work had been wrought among
them, and some of them had suffered for it. “Their angry
neighbours,” says Wesley, “had carried a whole wagon-load
of these new heretics before a magistrate. But when he asked
what they had done, there was a deep silence, for that was a
point their conductors had forgotten. At length, one said
‘they pretended to be better than other people, and prayed
from morning to night;’ and another said, ‘they have <i>convarted</i>
my wife. Till she went among them she had such a
tongue! and now she is as quiet as a lamb!’ ‘Take them
back, take them back,’ replied the justice, ‘and let them convert
all the scolds in the town.’”</p>

<p>As already intimated, Wesley’s preaching on his father’s
grave was attended with amazing power. On one occasion,
the people on every side wept aloud; and on another, several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
dropped down as dead; Wesley’s voice was drowned by the
cries of penitents; and many there and then, in the old
churchyard, found peace with God, and broke out into loud
thanksgiving. A gentleman, who had not been at public
worship of any kind for upwards of thirty years, stood motionless
as a statue. “Sir,” asked Wesley, “are you a sinner?”
“Sinner enough!” said he, and still stood staring upwards,
till his wife and servant, who were both in tears, put him
into his chaise, and took him home.</p>

<p>John Whitelamb, Wesley’s brother-in-law, clergyman at
Wroote, heard him preach at Epworth, and wrote him, saying,
“Your presence creates an awe, as if you were an inhabitant
of another world. I cannot think as you do; but I retain the
highest veneration and affection for you. The sight of you
moves me strangely. My heart overflows with gratitude. I
cannot refrain from tears, when I reflect, this is the man, who
at Oxford was more than a father to me; this is he, whom I
have there heard expound, or dispute publicly, or preach at
St. Mary’s, with such applause. I am quite forgotten. None
of the family ever honour me with a line! Have I been ungrateful?
I have been passionate, fickle, a fool; but I hope
I shall never be ungrateful.”<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>On receiving this, Wesley hastened to visit his old friend;
preached, on his way, at Haxey; then again in Whitelamb’s
church; and again, at night, on his father’s tomb, to an
immense multitude, the last service lasting for about three
hours. He writes, “We scarce knew how to part. Oh, let
none think his labour of love is lost because the fruit does not
immediately appear! Near forty years did my father labour
here; but he saw little fruit of all his labour. I took some
pains among this people too; and my strength also seemed
spent in vain: but now the fruit appeared. There were scarce
any in the town on whom either my father or I had taken
any pains formerly, but the seed, sown so long since, now
sprung up, bringing forth repentance and remission of sins.”</p>

<p>Thus, despite Mr. Romley’s railing at the enthusiast, his
churchyard became the scene of some of Wesley’s greatest
triumphs. John Whitelamb, writing to Charles Wesley, says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
“I had the honour and happiness of seeing and conversing
with my brother John. He behaved to me truly like himself.
I found in him, what I have always experienced heretofore,
the gentleman, the friend, the brother, and the Christian.”<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s visit to Epworth was a memorable one; and it
is not surprising that artists have vied with each other in portraying
it. Thousands of Methodist homes have pictures of
Wesley preaching on his father’s tomb; and the scene itself,
throughout all time, will be regarded as one of the most striking
incidents in Wesley’s history. Here, at Epworth, Wesley’s
venerable father had toiled, with exemplary diligence and
fidelity, for the long space of nine-and-thirty years; a man
who, for strength of mind and godly earnestness, had few
superiors; and yet, a man whose life was a perpetual worry of
poverty and persecution. Here, Wesley’s almost unequalled
mother, during the whole of that period, had been the sharer
of her husband’s joys and sorrows. Here had been nurtured
a family, who, for genius, talent, and romantic history, must
always stand high among the remarkable households of mankind.
The family was now scattered. Seven years had elapsed
since the father’s death. Samuel, the eldest, and Keziah, the
youngest of the children, (that survived the days of infancy,)
had since expired. And what about the widowed mother?
We shall soon see.</p>

<p>Wesley left Epworth on the 14th of June; and, after preaching
for four days in Sheffield and the neighbourhood, he
hastened to the Countess of Huntingdon’s, and thence, by
way of Coventry, Evesham, and Stroud, to the city of
Bristol, which he reached on June 28.</p>

<p>Within a month after this, his venerable mother exchanged
earth for heaven. Hearing of her illness, he hastened from
Bristol to London to see her. Charles was absent, but her
five daughters were with her. Wesley writes: “I found my
mother on the borders of eternity; but she had no doubt or
fear; nor any desire but to depart and to be with Christ.”
She died of gout,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> on Friday, July 23. Early in the morning,
on awaking out of sleep, she cried, “My dear Saviour! Art
Thou come to help me at my last extremity?” In the after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>noon,
as soon as the intercession meeting at the Foundery
was ended, Wesley went to her, and found her pulse almost
gone, and her fingers dead. Her look was calm, and her eyes
were fixed upward. Wesley used the commendatory prayer,
and, with his sisters, sang a requiem to her parting soul. She
was perfectly sensible, but gasping for life. Within an hour,
she died without a struggle, groan, or sigh; and Wesley and
his sisters stood round her bed, and fulfilled her last request,
uttered a little before she lost her speech: “Children, as soon
as I am released, sing a psalm of praise to God.” The
remains of this sainted lady were interred on Sunday, August
1, in Bunhill-fields. An immense multitude was present;
Wesley performed the service; and then preached from Revelation
xx. 12, 13. “It was,” says he, “one of the most
solemn assemblies I ever saw, or expect to see on this side
eternity.”<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>Wesley spent the next three months in London and in
Bristol, and in journeying to and fro; his brother Charles
labouring, at the same time, at Newcastle and in the north.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August, he met his brother and Charles
Caspar Graves in Bristol. Mr. Graves had been a student of
St. Mary Magdalen College, Oxford, and was one of the
Oxford Methodists. Two years after the Wesleys left for
Georgia, the friends of Graves believed him to be “stark
mad,” and removed him from his college. He found peace
with God in 1738, and became an exceedingly zealous out-door
preacher; but, in 1740, he was persuaded, and almost
coerced, to sign a paper to the effect, that he now renounced
the principles and practice of the Methodists; that he was
heartily sorry he had occasioned scandal by attending their
meetings; and that, in future, he should avoid doing so.</p>

<p>For nearly two years, he acted accordingly; but, on meeting
the Wesleys in Bristol at the time above mentioned, he
wrote to the fellows of St. Mary Magdalen College, revoking
the document he had been led to sign, and declaring that he
now looked upon himself “to be under no kind of obligation
to observe anything contained in that scandalous paper, so
unchristianly imposed upon him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span></p>

<p>Immediately after this, Charles Wesley and Mr. Graves set
off for the north of England. Having spent a few days with
John Nelson and his Methodist friends at Birstal, they proceeded
to Newcastle. Mr. Graves returned to Birstal in about
a fortnight; but Charles Wesley continued among the colliers
of the Tyne, formed the Newcastle society, and did not return
to London until his brother was ready to take his place
in the month of November following.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>On his arrival, November 13, Wesley met, what he calls,
“the wild, staring, loving society;” he took them with him to
the sacrament at Allhallows church; he reproved some among
them who walked disorderly; and ascertained that few were
thoroughly convinced of sin, and scarcely any could witness
that their sins were pardoned. Great power, however, began
to attend his preaching. On one occasion, six or seven
dropped down as dead; and, at another time, several of the
genteel people were constrained to roar aloud for the disquietness
of their hearts.</p>

<p>He extended his labours to the surrounding villages. At
Whickham he “spoke strong, rough words;” but none of the
people seemed to regard his sayings. At Tanfield Leigh, he
preached “to a dead, senseless, unaffected congregation.” At
Horsley, notwithstanding a bitter frost, he preached in the
open air, the wind driving upon the congregation, and scattering
straw and thatch among them in all directions.</p>

<p>In Newcastle, though the season was winter, he preached
out of doors as often as he could; and, at other times, in a
room, in a narrow lane, now Lisle Street, nearly opposite
the site of Wesley’s Orphan House. This “room,” or
“tabernacle” (as it was also called) had been built “by a
fanatic of the name of Macdonald,” who had now removed
to Manchester.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> It was the first Methodist meeting-house in
the north of England.</p>

<p>The work accomplished was marvellous. It was only eight
months since Wesley entered Newcastle as a perfect stranger;
and, yet, there were now above eight hundred persons joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
together in his society, besides many others in the surrounding
towns and villages who had been benefited by his ministry.
He writes: “I never saw a work of God, in any other place,
so evenly and gradually carried on. It continually rose step
by step. Not so much seemed to be done at any one time,
as had frequently been done at Bristol or London; but something
at every time.”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Among these northern converts, there were not a few, who
subsequently rendered important service to the cause of
Christ; brave spirits who deserve a niche in Methodistic
history, but whom, for the present, we are reluctantly obliged
to pass in silence.</p>

<p>Such a society being formed, a place for meeting became
imperative. Several sites were offered; one outside the gate
of Pilgrim Street was bought; and, on December 20, the
foundation stone was laid; after which Wesley preached, but,
three or four times during the sermon, was obliged to stop,
that the people might engage in prayer and give thanks to
God. The building was calculated to cost £700; Wesley
had just twenty-six shillings towards this expenditure;<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> many
thought it would never be completed; but Wesley writes:
“I was of another mind; nothing doubting but, as it was
begun for God’s sake, He would provide what was needful
for the finishing it.”</p>

<p>This “clumsy, ponderous pile,” as John Hampson calls it,
was then the largest Methodist meeting-house in England.
“Clumsy and ponderous” we grant it was, but still a “pile”
hallowed by associations far too sacred to be easily forgotten.
Here one of the first Sunday-schools in the kingdom was
established, and had not fewer than a thousand children in
attendance. Here a Bible society existed before the British
and Foreign Bible Society was formed. Here was one of the
best choirs in England; and here, among the singers, were the
sons of Mr. Scott, afterwards the celebrated Lords Eldon and
Stowell.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Here was the resting place of John Wesley’s first
itinerants; and here colliers and keelmen, from all parts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
surrounding country, would assemble, and, after the evening
service, would throw themselves upon the benches, and sleep
the few remaining hours till Wesley preached at five next
morning.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> The “clumsy, ponderous” old Orphan House was
the head quarters of Methodism in the north of England.</p>

<p>Within the last four years Wesley had built “the room”
at Bristol, and the school at Kingswood; and he had bought,
and repaired, and almost rebuilt “that vast, uncouth heap
of ruins,” called “the Foundery.” He began in Bristol without
funds, but money had been furnished as he needed it;
and now, with £1 6<i>s.</i>, he begun to erect a building to cost
£700. Three months after laying the foundation stone, in
the inclement month of March, while the building was yet
without roof, doors, or windows, Wesley opened it by preaching
from the narrative of the rich man and Lazarus; and,
afterwards, amid bricks, mortar, and a builder’s usual <i>débris</i>,
held a watchnight, the light of a full moon probably being
the only illumination the damp, cold, unfinished building had,
and equinoctial gales and winter winds wafting the watchnight
hymns of these happy Methodists to a higher and holier
world than this. Truly the cradle in which Methodism was
rocked by the hand of Providence was often rough.</p>

<p>Having begun the building, it was high time for Wesley to
begin to find means to pay for it. Accordingly, he arranged
to leave his Newcastle friends on the last day of 1742. He
preached his farewell sermon—a sermon of two hours’ continuance—in
the open air; men, women, and children hung
upon him, and were unwilling to part with him; and, even
after he had mounted his horse and started on his journey,
“a muckle woman” kept her hold of him, and ran by his
horse’s side, through thick and thin, till the town was fairly
left behind him.</p>

<p>We thus find Methodism firmly rooted in Bristol, Kingswood,
London, and Newcastle; and, besides this, Wesley
writes: “In this year many other societies were formed in
Somersetshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Leicestershire,
Warwickshire, and Nottinghamshire, as well as the southern
parts of Yorkshire.”<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span></p>

<p>Not only were churches on earth multiplied, but additions
were made to the church in heaven. Mr. Dolman, who rarely
failed to be at the Foundery by five o’clock, died full of
love, and peace, and joy in believing. James Angel gave
up his spirit to God in the full triumph of faith. Mary
Whittle cried out: “It is done, it is done! Christ lives in
me;” and died in a moment. Another female member of
the London society expired with the words, “I fear not
death; it hath no sting for me. I shall live for evermore.”
Sarah Whiskin cried out, “My Lord and my God!” fetched
a double sigh, and died. John Woolley, a child of thirteen
years, threw his arms wide open, and said, “Come, come,
Lord Jesus! I am Thine;” and soon after breathed his
last. And Lucy Godshall died basking in the light of her
Saviour’s countenance. All these belonged to the London
society.</p>

<p>The purest gold is sometimes mixed with dross; and so it
was with Methodism. Some of the Foundery society fanatically
talked of feeling the blood of Christ running upon
their arms, their breasts, their hearts, and down their throats.
Wesley met them, and denounced their folly as the empty
dreams of heated imaginations. Good John Brown, of Tanfield
Leigh, two or three days after his conversion, came
riding through Newcastle, hallooing and shouting, and driving
all the people before him; telling them that God had revealed
to him that he should be a king, and should tread all
his enemies beneath his feet. Wesley arrested him, and sent
him home immediately, advising him to cry day and night to
God, lest the devil should gain an advantage over him. These
were rare exceptions, and were promptly checked.</p>

<p>Two, who called themselves <i>prophets</i>, came to Wesley in
London, stating, that they were sent from God to say, he
would shortly be <i>born’d</i> again; and that, unless he turned
them out, they would stay in the house till it was done. He
gravely answered, that he would not turn them out, and took
them down into the room of the society. Here he left them.
“It was tolerably cold,” says he, “and they had neither meat
nor drink. However, there they sat from morning to evening,
when they quietly went away, and I have heard nothing from
them since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span></p>

<p>In 1742, persecution by means of the public press had, to
some extent, abated;<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> but mobs and vulgar-minded men were
as violent as ever. At Long Lane, in London, they threw
large stones upon the house in which Wesley was preaching,
which, with the tiles, fell among the people, endangering their
lives. At Chelsea, burning substances were cast into the
room till it was filled with smoke. At Pensford, near Bristol,
a hired rabble brought a bull, which they had been baiting,
and tried to drive it among the people; and then, forcing their
way to the little table on which Wesley stood, they “tore it
bit from bit,” with fiendish vengeance. A similar outrage was
perpetrated in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel. The mob
did their utmost to force a herd of cattle among the congregation;
and then threw showers of stones, one of which
struck Wesley between the eyes; but, wiping away the
blood, he continued the service as if nought had happened.
At Cardiff, while Charles Wesley was preaching, women
were kicked, and their clothes set on fire by rockets, thrown
into the room among them; the desk in which the preacher
stood was dashed to pieces, and the Bible wrested from his
hands, one of the brutal persecutors solemnly declaring that,
if he went straight to hell for doing it, he would persecute the
Methodists to his dying day.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of such violence, Wesley calmly pursued the
path of duty, praying, preaching, visiting the sick and dying,
forming societies, building chapels, reading, writing, and
publishing.</p>

<p>During the year, he read Dr. Pitcairn’s works,—“dry, sour,
and controversial;” Jacob Behmen’s Exposition of Genesis,
the “most sublime nonsense, inimitable bombast, fustian not to
be paralleled, all of a piece with his inspired interpretation of
the word <i>tetragrammaton</i>; Madame Guyon’s “Short Method
of Prayer,” and “Les Torrents Spirituelles,” from which “poor
quietist” the Moravians had taken many of their unscriptural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
expressions; “The Life of Ignatius Loyola,” “a surprising
book,” concerning “one of the greatest men that ever engaged
in supporting so bad a cause;” and “The Life of
Gregory Lopez,” “a good and wise, though much mistaken
man.”</p>

<p>Wesley’s publications, during 1742, were the following:—</p>

<p>1. “A Companion for the Altar. Extracted from Thomas
à Kempis.” 12mo, 24 pages.</p>

<p>2. “An Extract of the Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s Journal,
from August 12, 1738, to November 1, 1739.” 12mo, 98 pages.</p>

<p>3. “A Treatise on Christian Prudence. Extracted from
Mr. Norris.”<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> 12mo, 35 pages.</p>

<p>4. “A Collection of Hymns, translated from the German;”
36 pages. These were twenty-four in number, and had previously
been published in his “Hymns and Sacred Poems.”</p>

<p>5. “A Narrative of the Work of God, at and near Northampton
in New England. Extracted from Mr. Edwards’s
Letter to Dr. Coleman.” 12mo, 48 pages.</p>

<p>6. “A Collection of Tunes set to Music, as they are commonly
sung at the Foundery.” Duodecimo, of thirty-six
pages, containing forty-three tunes for one voice only, some
set in the treble and some in the tenor clef.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>Great revivals of religion have generally been attended by
copious productions of hymns of praise; and thus it was at
the rise of Methodism. This was emphatically the great era
of hymn writing in the English church. Watts, Doddridge,
and Erskine poured forth the joys of their converted
hearts, and furnished lyric lines, which have been used, in
sacred worship, by millions. But of all the hymnists then
living, the Wesleys were the most remarkable. A competent
authority has estimated that, during Wesley’s lifetime there
were published not fewer than six thousand six hundred
hymns from the pen of Charles Wesley only.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Having
furnished their societies with so many hymns, no wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
that the Wesleys collected and furnished tunes. Their religion
made them happy; and happiness always finds vent
in song. The old Methodists were remarkable for their
singing. Why? Because their hearts throbbed with the “joy
unspeakable and full of glory.” Make a man happy, and he
is sure to sing. Thus it was with Wesley and the thousands
who looked to him as their great leader. Naturally, the
Wesleys were full of poetry; and religion, so far from extinguishing
the fire, fanned it into a holy flame. Their taste
in music may be gathered from Wesley’s directions to his
preachers. “Suit the tune to the words. Avoid complex
tunes, which it is scarcely possible to sing with devotion.
Repeating the same words so often, especially while another
repeats different words, shocks all common sense, necessarily
brings in dead formality, and has no more religion in it than
a Lancashire hornpipe. Sing no anthems. Do not suffer the
people to sing too slow. In every society, let them learn to
sing; and let them always learn our own tunes first. Let the
women constantly sing their parts alone. Let no man sing
with them, unless he understands the notes, and sings the
bass, as it is pricked down in the book. Introduce no new
tunes till they are perfect in the old. Let no organ be placed
anywhere, till proposed in the Conference. Recommend our
tune-book everywhere; and if you cannot sing yourself,
choose a person or two in each place to pitch the tune for
you. Exhort every one in the congregation to sing, not
one in ten only.”<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>Well would it be if Methodist ministers were to enforce
such rules as these, instead of leaving the most beautiful part
of public worship, as is too often done, to the irreligious whims
and criminal caprice of organists and choirs. No one can
doubt the fact that, within the last forty years, the singing in
Methodist chapels has deteriorated to an extent which ought
to be alarming. The tunes now too generally sung are
intolerably insipid; and, as to any sympathy between them
and the inspiriting hymns of Charles Wesley, it would
be preposterous to say that a particle of such sympathy
exists. Such singing may suit the <i>classic</i> taste of fashionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
congregations assembled amid the chilling influence of gothic
decorations; but it bears no resemblance whatever to the
general outbursts of heartfelt praise, adoration, and thanksgiving,
which characterised the old Methodists. It is high
time for Methodist preachers to keep John Wesley’s rules
respecting singing; to substitute John Wesley’s tunes and
others like them for the soulless sounds now called classic
music; and to feel that, before God and man, they are as
much responsible for the singing in sanctuaries as they are
for that part of public worship which consists of prayer.</p>

<p>7. Wesley’s last publication, in 1742, was “The Principles
of a Methodist,” 12mo, 32 pages. This was written in reply
to a pamphlet of the Rev. Josiah Tucker, who had tried to
show that the Methodists, in the first instance, had been
the disciples of William Law the mystic, and then of the
Moravians; and, that now their principles were a perfect
“medley of Calvinism, Arminianism, Quakerism, Quietism,
and Montanism, all thrown together.”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>In reply to the charge of believing inconsistencies, Wesley
remarks:—1. That Mr. Law’s system of truth had never been
the creed of the Methodists. He himself was eight years at
Oxford before he read any of Mr. Law’s writings; and when
he did read them, so far from making them his creed, he had
objections to almost every page. 2. That the Germans, with
whom he travelled to Georgia, infused into him no ideas about
justification, or anything else; for he came back with the
same notions he had when he went; but Peter Bohler’s
affirmation that true faith in Christ is always attended with
“dominion over sin, and constant peace from a sense of
forgiveness,” and that “justification was an instantaneous
work,”—led him to make anxious inquiry, which resulted in
his conviction, that Bohler’s doctrine was true, and that,
notwithstanding all his past good performances, he himself
was still without true faith in Christ. 3. He repudiates the
inconsistent creed which Mr. Tucker puts into his mouth, and
concludes as follows:—“I may say many things which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
been said before, and perhaps by Calvin or Arminius, by
Montanus or Barclay, or the Archbishop of Cambray; but
it cannot thence be inferred that I hold a ‘medley of all their
principles,—Calvinism, Arminianism, Montanism, Quakerism,
Quietism, all thrown together,’ There might as well have
been added Judaism, Mahommedanism, Paganism. It would
have made the period rounder, and been full as easily proved,
I mean asserted; for no other proof is yet produced.”</p>

<p>This was Wesley’s first battle. In his “address to the
reader,” he remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have often wrote on controverted points before; but not with an eye
to any particular person. So that this is the first time I have appeared
in controversy, properly so called. Indeed I have not wanted occasion
to do it before; particularly when, after many stabs in the dark, I was
publicly attacked, not by an open enemy, but by my own familiar friend.”
[Whitefield.] “But I could not answer him. I could only cover my face
and say, Και συ εις εκεινων; και συy, τεκνον; ‘Art thou also among them?
art thou, my son?’</p>

<p>“I now tread an untried path, ‘with fear and trembling’; fear, not of
my adversary, but of myself. I fear my own spirit, lest I ‘fall where
many mightier have been slain.’ Every disputant seems to think (as every
soldier) that he may hit his opponent as much as he can; nay, that he
ought to do his worst to him, or he cannot make the best of his own
cause.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley then denounces this mode of conducting controversy,
and declares that he wishes to treat Mr. Tucker and all
opponents as he would treat his own brother. In such a
spirit, Wesley began his long continued, perhaps unparalleled,
controversial life.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1743<br />

Age  40</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the year 1743, Wesley spent about fourteen
weeks in London, ten in Bristol and its vicinity,
thirteen in Newcastle and the neighbourhood, three in Cornwall,
and twelve in travelling chiefly to the north of England.
He was now a thorough itinerant; and itinerating in England
then was widely different from what it is at present. Turnpike
roads did not exist; and no stage coach went farther north
than the town of York.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Wesley travelled on horseback,
reading as he rode, and usually having one of his preachers
with him. In a life like this, there was much of both hardship
and incident. For instance, on New Year’s day, between
Doncaster and Epworth, he met a man so drunk that he could
hardly keep his seat, but who, on discovering that Wesley
was his fellow traveller, cried out, “I am a Christian! I am a
Churchman! I am none of your Culamites!” And then, as if
afraid that Wesley might turn out to be the devil, away
he went, as fast as his horse could carry him. Twelve days
after, on reaching Stratford upon Avon, Wesley was requested
to visit a woman of middle age, who, with a distorted face,
and a lolling tongue, had bellowed so horribly, in the presence
of the parish minister, that he pronounced her possessed
with demons. Wesley went, but, staring at her visitor,
she said nothing ailed her. After singing a verse or two,
Wesley and his friends began to pray. Just as he commenced,
he felt as if he “had been plunged into cold water,”
and immediately there was a tremendous roar. The woman
was reared up in bed, her whole body moving, without bending
either joint or limb. Then it writhed into all kinds of
postures, the poor wretch still bellowing. Wesley, however,
continued praying, until all demoniacal symptoms ceased, and
the woman began rejoicing and praising God. On another
occasion, in the month of April, while baiting his horse at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
Sandhutton, he found sitting, in the chimney corner of the
public house, a good natured man, who was enjoying his grog
with the greatest gusto. Wesley began to talk to him about
sacred things, having no suspicion that he was talking to the
parish priest. And yet so it was; but the reverend tippler,
instead of boiling over with offence, begged his reprover to call
upon him when he next visited his village. In July, when
he and John Downes reached Darlington, from Newcastle, both
their horses lay down and died; and, in August, when he was
leaving London for Bristol, his saddle slipped upon his horse’s
neck; he was jerked over the horse’s head; and the horse
itself ran back to Smithfield. Six days later, being in Exeter,
he went to church both morning and afternoon, and writes:
“the sermon in the morning was quite innocent of meaning;
what that in the afternoon was, I know not; for I could not
hear a single sentence.” In October, when he was leaving
Epworth, he had to cross the Trent in a ferry boat; a terrible
storm was raging; and the cargo consisted of three horses
and eight men and women. In the midst of the river, the
side of the boat was under water, and the horses and men
rolling one over another, while Wesley was laid in the
bottom, pinned down with a large iron bar, and utterly unable
to help himself. Presently, however, the horses jumped
into the water, and the boat was lightened, and came safe
to land. Such were some of the incidents Wesley met with
in 1743.</p>

<p>One of the first events in this memorable year was the
organisation of the Calvinistic Methodists in Wales. At a
meeting held at Watford (near Cardiff), on January 5 and 6,
and at which there were present four clergymen—Whitefield,
Rowlands, Powell, and Williams, and three laymen—Howel
Harris, Joseph Humphreys, and John Cennick, it was agreed
that “public exhorters” should be employed, and that each
“public exhorter,” with the assistance of “private exhorters,”
should take the oversight of twelve or fourteen societies.
Each “private exhorter” was to inspect only one or two
societies, and was to follow his ordinary calling. Howel
Harris was to be a general travelling superintendent; and
the clergymen were to itinerate as much as they were able.
Each society was to have a box, under the care of stewards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
to receive weekly contributions towards the support of the
general work; and the clergymen and exhorters were to meet
in conference once, or oftener, every year.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Thus Whitefield,
Harris, Humphreys, and Cennick began to <i>organise</i> their
societies before the Wesleys did.</p>

<p>After an absence of seven weeks, Wesley returned to
Newcastle, on the 19th of February, and at once set to work
to purge the society of unworthy members. Since he left,
on December 30, seventy-six had forsaken the society; and
sixty-four were now expelled, about eight hundred still
remaining. Of those who had voluntarily withdrawn themselves,
a large proportion were Dissenters, who left, because
otherwise their ministers refused to them the sacrament;
thirty-three because their husbands, wives, parents, masters,
or acquaintance objected; five because such bad things were
said of the society; nine because they would not be laughed
at; one because she was afraid of falling into fits; and
fourteen for sundry other reasons. Among those expelled,
there were two for swearing; two for sabbath breaking;
seventeen for drunkenness; two for retailing spirituous
liquors; three for quarreling; one for beating his wife; three
for wilful lying; four for railing; one for laziness; and twenty-nine
for lightness and carelessness. Thus, within a few months
after its formation, the Newcastle society was purged of one
hundred and forty of its members.</p>

<p>Joined with Newcastle were a number of country places,
at each of which Wesley preached every week, excepting
Swalwell, where he went only once a fortnight. These were
Horsley, Pelton, Chowden, South Biddick, Tanfield, Birtley,
and Placey. At Chowden, he found he had got into the very
Kingswood of the north; twenty or thirty wild children, in
rags and almost nakedness, flocking round about him. At
Pelton, in the midst of the sermon, one of the colliers began
to shout amain from an excess of joy; but their usual token
of approbation was clapping Wesley on the back. At Placey,
the colliers had always been in the first rank for savage
ignorance and all kinds of wickedness. Every Sunday men,
women, and children met together to dance, fight, curse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
swear, and play at chuck ball, span farthing, or whatever came
to hand; but, notwithstanding this, when Wesley went among
them, on the 1st of April, and preached amid wind, sleet, and
snow till he was encased in ice, “they gave earnest heed to
the things which were spoken.”</p>

<p>In Newcastle, almost every night, there were scenes of great
excitement. Numbers dropped down, lost their strength, and
were seized with agonies. Some said, they felt as if a sword
was running through them; others thought a great weight
upon them; others could hardly breathe; and others felt as
if their bodies were being torn to pieces. “These symptoms,”
says Wesley, “I can no more impute to any natural causes,
than to the Spirit of God. I can make no doubt, but it was
Satan tearing them, as they were coming to Christ. And
hence proceeded those grievous cries, whereby he might
design both to discredit the work of God, and to affright
fearful people from hearing that word whereby their souls
might be saved.”</p>

<p>Wesley left on April 7, and on the 30th of May was
succeeded by his brother. Charles put an end to these
annoying fits, and says, “I am more and more convinced it
was a device of Satan to stop the course of the gospel.”
He preached to “a thousand wild people” at Sunderland.
At South Shields, his congregation consisted of “a huge
multitude; many of them very fierce and threatening”;
while the churchwardens and others tried to interrupt him
by throwing dirt, and even money among the people. The
mob at North Shields, led on by the parish priest, roughly
saluted him; his reverence commanding a man to blow a
horn, and his companions to shout.</p>

<p>Charles left on the 21st of June, and, eight days afterwards,
was succeeded by John. The society was further reduced, by
fresh backslidings, to about six hundred members. Wesley
spent nearly three weeks among them; formed a society out
of “his favourite congregation at Placey;” and then returned
to London.</p>

<p>He came again on October 31st, and found the following
advertisement was published:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span></p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">For the Benefit of Mr. Este.</span><br />
<br />
By the Edinburgh Company of Comedians, on Friday, November 4,<br />
<br />
will be acted a Comedy, called<br />
<br />
THE CONSCIOUS LOVERS;<br />
<br />
To which will be added, a Farce, called,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Trick upon Trick, or Methodism Displayed</span>.”<br />
</p>

<p>The day came; and about fifteen hundred people assembled
in Moot Hall to see the funny farce, some hundreds having
to sit upon the stage. Soon after the comedians began the
first act of “The Conscious Lovers,” the seats upon the stage
broke down, and their occupants were left sprawling in all
directions. In the midst of the second act, all the shilling
seats gave a crack, and began to sink. The people shrieked,
and numbers ran away. When the third act was commencing,
the entire stage suddenly sunk about six inches, and
the players precipitately fled. At the end of the act, all
the sixpenny seats, in a moment, fell with an alarming crash,
which caused cries on every side. Most of the people had
now left the hall, but, two or three hundred still remaining,
Este, who was to act the Methodist, came forward and told
them he was determined that the farce should be performed.
While he was speaking, the stage sunk six inches more;
when the valorous comedian and the remnant of his audience
took to their heels in the utmost confusion. The week after,
however, the farce was acted, and hundreds of people went
again to see it.</p>

<p>One or two incidents in connection with Wesley’s northern
journeys may be noticed here.</p>

<p>While returning to the south, at the beginning of the year,
he was, for the first time in his life, repelled from the sacramental
table. This occurred at Epworth. Having preached, on
his father’s tomb, to a large congregation, gathered from the
neighbouring towns, and it being the sacramental Sunday,
some of the people went to Romley, the curate, to ask his
permission to communicate; to whom the proud priest replied,
“Tell Mr. Wesley, I shall not give <i>him</i> the sacrament; for he
is not <i>fit</i>.” Wesley writes, “How wise a God is our God!
there could not have been so fit a place under heaven, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
this should befal me first, as my father’s house, the place of
my nativity, and the very place where, ‘according to the
straitest sect of our religion,’ I had so long ‘lived a Pharisee.’
It was also fit, in the highest degree, that he who repelled me
from that very table where I had myself so often distributed
the bread of life, should be one who owed his all in this world
to the tender love which my father had shown to his, as well
as personally to himself.”</p>

<p>While on his third journey to Newcastle, in 1743, Wesley
paid his first visit to the town of Grimsby. Here a woman—a
magdalen, who was parted from her husband—offered him a
convenient place for preaching, and, under his sermon, became
a penitent. Wesley, after hearing her domestic history, told
her she must return instantly to her forsaken spouse. She
replied, her husband was at Newcastle, and she knew not how
to reach him. Wesley said, “I am going to Newcastle to-morrow
morning. William Blow is going with me; and you
shall ride behind him.” This was an odd arrangement, and
perhaps not too prudent; but it was carried out. The poor
creature rode to Newcastle, sad and sombre; there she met
her husband; and, a short time after, was drowned at sea,
while on her way to Hull.</p>

<p>The year 1743 will always be memorable for the riots in
Staffordshire. At this period, West Bromwich was an open
common, covered with heath, and burrowed with rabbit warrens.
Wednesbury was a small country town, irregularly built, the
roads following ancient footways, and leaving wide spaces
unoccupied. One of these was called the “High Bullen,”
and was the place where bulls were baited. So extensively
did this barbarous sport prevail in the “black country,” that,
in Tipton parish, nineteen of these furious animals were
baited at one of the annual wakes. Wednesbury, however,
was most celebrated for its cockfights. Indeed, the Wednesbury
“cockings,” as Charles Knight informs us, were almost
as famous as the races of the “Derby day” at the present
time. Recreations are an index to character, and sports, such
as these, reflected, as well as moulded, the moral condition of
the people.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley, accompanied by Mr. Graves, was the first
Methodist who preached at Wednesbury. This was in No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>vember,
1742.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> His brother followed in January, 1743, and
spent four days among the people, preached eight sermons,
and formed a society of about one hundred members.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Mr.
Egginton, the vicar, was extremely courteous, told Wesley
he had done much good already, and he doubted not would
do much more, invited him to his house, and said the oftener
he came the better.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Wesley was followed by Mr. Williams, a Welshman, who, it
is alleged, vilified the clergy, and called them dumb dogs
that could not bark. After him came a bricklayer; then a
plumber and glazier, both sent from London; and, under
their preaching, people fell down in fits, and made strange
hideous noises. Malice, spleen, and feuds sprung up. The
Methodists spoke ill natured things of their lawful minister,
and told the members of the Church of England, that they
would all be damned. These things, it is said, exasperated
ignorant people, and were the principal cause of the subsequent
disturbances.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Wesley paid a second visit to Wednesbury
on the 15th of April, and says, “the inexcusable
folly of Mr. Williams had so provoked Mr. Egginton, that
his former love was turned into bitter hatred.” Wesley went
to church, where Egginton delivered, with great bitterness
of voice and manner, what Wesley pronounced, the most
wicked sermon he ever heard; and, two days afterwards,
while he himself was preaching, a neighbouring parson, who
was extremely drunk, after using many unseemly and bitter
words, tried to ride over his congregation.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley came on the 20th of May, and found the
society increased to above three hundred. “The enemy,” he
writes, “rages exceedingly, and preaches against them. A
few have returned railing for railing; but the generality have
behaved as the followers of Christ.” A Dissenter had given
a piece of ground upon which to build a chapel, and Charles
says, “I consecrated it by a hymn.” He went to Walsal,
accompanied by many of the brethren, singing songs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
praise. He preached from the steps of the market house,
the mob roaring, shouting, and throwing stones incessantly.
Many struck him, but none hurt him.</p>

<p>Soon after this, while a small party of Wednesbury Methodists
were returning from Darlaston, singing hymns, the Darlaston
mob began to pelt them with stones and dirt; while
the united mobs of Darlaston, Walsal, and Bilston smashed
the windows of most of the Methodist houses in Wednesbury,
Darlaston, and West Bromwich.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> In some instances, money
was extorted, and in others furniture was broken, spoiled, or
stolen; and even pregnant women were beaten with clubs
and otherwise abused.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> John Adams, John Eaton, and
Francis Ward went to Walsal for a warrant to apprehend the
rioters. The magistrate, Mr. Persehouse, told them they had
themselves to blame for the outrage that had been committed,
and refused their application.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> The mob hurled against
them all sorts of missiles, and when the magistrate was
asked to quiet these disturbers of the public peace, he
swung his hat round his head, and cried, “Huzza!” Mr.
Taylor, the curate of Walsal, came, not to stop the outrage,
but to encourage the rioters in their violence. One of them
struck Francis Ward on the eye, and cut it so, that he expected
to lose his sight. He went into a shop and had it
dressed, when the ruffians again pursued him, and beat him
most unmercifully. He escaped into the public house, and
was again fetched out, and dragged along the street, and
through the public kennels, till he lost his strength, and was
hardly able to stand erect.</p>

<p>Wesley writes, June 18th: “I received a full account of
the terrible riots which had been in Staffordshire. I was not
surprised at all, neither should I have wondered if, after the
advices they had so often received from the pulpit, as well as
from the episcopal chair, the zealous high churchmen had
rose and cut all that were Methodists in pieces.”</p>

<p>He immediately set out to assist the poor Methodists, as
far as he was able, and came to Francis Ward’s on the 22nd.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
After hearing the statements of the people, he “thought it
best to inquire whether there could be any help from the laws
of the land”; and rode to Counsellor Littleton at Tamworth,
to ask his opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>The mob were still as violent as ever. On the very day
before Wesley’s arrival at Francis Ward’s, a large crowd came
to the house of John Eaton, who was a constable. John went
to the door, with his constable’s staff, and began to read the
act of parliament against riots; but stones flew so thick
about his head, that he was obliged to leave off reading
and to retire. They then broke all his windows, destroyed
the door of his dwelling, and smashed his clock to pieces.
On the same day, two or three of the Methodists were singing
a hymn in John Adams’ house, when a pack of apprentices
came and threw stones through the windows. A mob destroyed
Jonas Turner’s windows with a club, threw three
baskets full of stones to break his furniture, and ruthlessly
dragged him along the ground a distance of sixty yards.
They went to Mary Turner’s house, at West Bromwich, and
hunted her and her two daughters with stones and stakes,
threatening to knock them on the head, and to bury them in
a ditch. They came to John Bird’s house, felled his daughter,
snatched money from his wife, and then broke ten of his
windows, besides destroying sash frames, shutters, chests of
drawers, doors, and dressers. They took Humphrey Hands
by the throat, swore they would be the death of him, gave
him a great swing, and hurled him on the ground. On rising,
they struck him on the eye, and again knocked him down.
They then smashed all his windows, shivered many of his
household goods, and broke all the shelves, drawers, pots, and
bottles in his shop, and destroyed almost all his medicines.
All this happened within a day or two of Wesley’s coming
to Francis Ward’s. Indeed, at this very time, there were in
and about Wednesbury more than eighty houses, all of which
had their windows damaged, and in many of which not
three panes of glass were left unbroken.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Counsellor Littleton assured Wesley they might have an
easy remedy, if they resolutely prosecuted, as the law directed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
and doubtless this encouraged John Griffiths and Francis
Ward to apply, at the end of June, to another magistrate for
protection and redress; but, having stated their case to his
worship, he talked to them roughly, made game of them,
refused a warrant, and said, “I suppose you follow these parsons
that come about. I will neither meddle nor make.”</p>

<p>For some time, preaching was suspended; and then came
Messrs. Graves and Williams, who, however, confined their
preaching to private houses.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> At length, on October 20, Wesley
himself again entered this wild beasts’ den. At noon, he
preached in the centre of the town, and was not disturbed;
but, two or three hours afterwards, while he was writing at
Francis Ward’s, the mob beset the house, and cried, “Bring
out the minister; we will have the minister!” At Wesley’s
request, three of the most furious came into the house, and,
after the interchange of a few sentences, were perfectly
appeased. With these men to clear the way, Wesley went
out, and, standing in the midst of the surging mob, asked
them what they wanted with him. Some said, “We want you
to go with us to the justice.” Wesley replied, “That I will,
with all my heart”; and away they went. Before they had
walked a mile, the night came on, accompanied with heavy
rain. Bentley Hall, the residence of Mr. Lane, the magistrate,
was two miles distant. Some pushed forward, and
told Mr. Lane, that they were bringing Wesley before his
worship. “What have I to do with Wesley?” quoth the
magistrate; “take him back again.” Presently the crowd
came up, and began knocking for admittance. A servant
told them his master was in bed. The magistrate declined
to see them, but his son asked their business. A spokesman
answered, “To be plain, sir, if I must speak the truth, all the
fault I find with him is, that he preaches better than our
parsons.” Another said, “Sir, it is a downright shame; he
makes people rise at five in the morning to sing psalms.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
What advice would your worship give us?” “Go home,”
said Lane, the younger, “and be quiet.”</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to obtain an audience of Mr. Lane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
they then hurried Wesley to Walsal, to Mr. justice Persehouse.
It was now about seven o’clock, and, of course, was
dark. Persehouse, however, also refused to see them, on
the ground that, like magisterial Mr. Lane, he was gone
to bed; and hence there was nothing for it but to trudge
back again. About fifty of the crowd undertook to be
Wesley’s convoy; but, before they had gone more than a
hundred yards, the mob of Walsal ran after them; some
were pelted; others fled; and Wesley was left, alone and
unbefriended, in the hands of the victorious ruffians. Some
tried to seize him by the collar, and to pull him down. A
big lusty fellow, just behind him, struck him several times
with an oaken club. Another rushed through the crowd,
lifted his arm to strike, but, on a sudden, let it drop, and only
stroked Wesley’s head, saying “What soft hair he has!” One
man struck him on the breast; and another on the mouth,
with such force, that the blood gushed out. He was dragged
back to Walsal; and, attempting to enter a large house, the
door of which was standing open, he was seized by the hair
of the head, and hindered. He was then paraded through
the main street, from one end of Walsal to the other. Here he
stood, and asked, “Are you willing to hear me speak?” Many
cried, “No, no! knock out his brains; down with him; kill him
at once!” Wesley asked, “What evil have I done? which of
you all have I wronged in word or deed?” Again they cried,
“Bring him away, bring him away!” Wesley began to pray;
and now a man, who just before headed the mob, turned and
said, “Sir, I will spend my life for you; follow me, and no
one shall hurt a hair of your head.” Two or three of his
companions joined him; the mob parted; and these three or
four brave ruffians, the captains of the rabble on all occasions,
and one of them a prizefighter in a bear garden, took Wesley
and carried him safely through the infuriated crowd. He
writes: “a little before ten o’clock, God brought me safe to
Wednesbury; having lost only one flap of my waistcoat, and
a little skin from one of my hands. From the beginning to the
end I found the same presence of mind, as if I had been sitting
in my own study. But I took no thought for one moment
before another; only once it came into my mind, that, if they
should throw me into the river, it would spoil the papers that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
were in my pocket. For myself, I did not doubt but I should
swim across, having but a thin coat and a light pair of boots.”</p>

<p>It is right to add, that, in the midst of all these perils, there
were four brave Methodists who clung to Wesley, resolved to
live or die with him, namely, William Sitch, Edward Slater,
John Griffiths, and Joan Parks. When Wesley asked William
Sitch, what he expected when the mob seized them, William
answered with a martyr’s spirit, “To die for Him, who died
for us.” And when Joan Parks was asked if she was not
afraid, she said: “No, no more than I am now. I could trust
God for you, as well as for myself.”</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of Methodism in the “black
country.” “The heathen raged, and the people imagined a
vain thing. But He that sitteth in the heavens laughed; the
Lord had them in derision.” Human justice there was none;
but Divine protection was sufficient. Wesley was carried to
the houses of Lane and Persehouse, but these two magisterial
worthies refused to see him; and yet, only eight days before,
they had the effrontery to issue the following proclamation,
which Wesley justly calls one of the greatest curiosities, of
the kind, that England had ever seen:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>To all High Constables, Petty Constables, and other of His Majesty’s
Peace Officers, within the county of Staffordshire, and particularly to the
Constable of Tipton</i>:—</p>

<p>“Whereas, we, His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the said county
of Stafford, have received information, that several disorderly persons,
styling themselves Methodist preachers, go about raising routs and riots,
to the great damage of His Majesty’s liege people, and against the peace
of our Sovereign Lord the King.</p>

<p>“These are in His Majesty’s name, to command you, and every one of
you, within your respective districts, to make diligent search after the said
Methodist preachers, and to bring him or them before some of us His
said Majesty’s Justices of the Peace, to be examined concerning their
unlawful doings.</p>

<p>“Given under our hands and seals, this 12th day of October, 1743.</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">J. Lane</span>,<br />
“<span class="smcap">W. Persehouse</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, however, that, notwithstanding
Wesley’s rough usage, and the pretentiously loyal proclamation
of these two unjust justices, Charles Wesley boldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
bearded the lions in their den only five days after his brother
so miraculously escaped. He found the poor Methodists
“standing fast in one mind and spirit, in nothing terrified
by their adversaries.” He writes: “Never before was I in so
primitive an assembly. We sung praises lustily, and with a
good courage; and could all set our seal to the truth of
our Lord’s saying, ‘Blessed are they that are persecuted for
righteousness’ sake.’ We assembled before day to sing hymns
of praise to Christ; and, as soon as it was light, I walked
down the town, and preached boldly on Revelation ii. 10. It
was a most glorious time. Our souls were satisfied as with
marrow and fatness, and we longed for our Lord’s coming to
confess us before His Father and His holy angels.”<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>Even this is not all. The clergyman at Darlaston was so
struck with the meek behaviour of the Methodists, in the
midst of suffering, that he offered to join the Wesleys in
punishing the rioters;<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> while “honest Munchin,” as he was
called, the captain of the rabble, who first came to Wesley’s
help and rescued him, was so impressed with his spirit and
behaviour, that he immediately forsook his gang of godless
companions, joined the Methodists, and was received, by
Charles Wesley, as a member on trial, only five days after
Wesley’s deliverance. “What thought you of my brother?”
asked Charles Wesley of “honest Munchin.” “Think of
him!” said he, “I thought he is a <i>mon</i> of God; and God
was on his side, when so <i>mony</i> of us could not kill one
<i>mon</i>.”</p>

<p>It may here be added, that “Munchin” was a nickname
only,—a provincial word expressive of coarse, brutal strength.
The real name of Wesley’s deliverer was George Clifton. He
lived in a small house at the foot of Holloway Bank, and
never tired of telling, in after days, how God stayed his hand,
when he nearly took Wesley’s life. He died in Birmingham,
at the age of eighty-five, in the year 1789, and was buried in
St. Paul’s churchyard. It is a notable incident<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> that, while
Wesley’s persecutors passed quickly away, nearly all who
took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, lived, like “honest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
Munchin,” a long and a peaceful life, and saw their children’s
children walking in the fear of God.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the “Staffordshire riots” did not terminate
in October, 1743; and, in order to complete the summary, we
must trespass, for a moment, on the events of 1744.</p>

<p>We learn from the pamphlet already quoted, “Papers
giving an account of the Rise and Progress of Methodism at
Wednesbury and in other parishes adjacent,” that, after the
bold visit of Charles Wesley, Messrs. Graves and Williams,
who, for months past, had preached only in private houses,
now begun to preach publicly. At Christmas, Whitefield
came and spent several days in preaching in the streets with
his accustomed eloquence and power; and then, on February
2, 1744, Charles Wesley again entered the field of action.
Egginton, the Wednesbury vicar, had drawn up a paper, and
sent the crier to give notice, that all the Methodists must sign
it, or else their houses would be immediately demolished. It
was to this effect, “that they would never read, or sing, or
pray together, or hear the Methodist parsons any more.”
Several signed through fear; and every one who did was
mulcted a penny to assist in making the rabble drunk.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>This was not more than about a month before Charles
Wesley’s visit. When he came, however, Egginton was dead;
but, in the meantime, not a Methodist in Darlaston had
escaped the renewed violence of the vicar’s godless mob,
except two or three who had bought exemption by giving
their purses to the lawless gang. The windows of all the
Methodists were broken, neither glass, lead, nor frames
remaining. Tables, chairs, chests of drawers, and whatever
furniture was not easily removable, were dashed in pieces.
Feather beds were torn to shreds, and the feathers strewed
about the rooms<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> in all directions.</p>

<p>No craven-hearted parson would have ventured to preach
to humanised fiends like these; and yet these were pre-eminently
the men whom the Wesleys tried to benefit and
save. At the risk of being murdered, they fearlessly told
them of their sin and danger. More than once they had
hazarded their lives; and now, Charles was in the midst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
these begrimed ruffians, as courageous as ever. He escaped,
but the poor Methodists were again made to suffer from the
more than brutal violence of their fiendish neighbours.</p>

<p>One man’s wife, about Candlemas, was abused in a manner
too horrible to relate; and, because he tried to bring some of
the recreants to justice, his windows were broken; his furniture
and tools destroyed; all his wife’s linen was torn to tatters;
his bed and bedstead were cut; and his Bible and Prayer-Book
pulled to pieces. On Shrove Tuesday, the house of
Francis Ward was forcibly entered, and all his goods were
stolen. John Darby’s house was broken open, his furniture
and five stalls of bees destroyed, and his poultry filched.
Other houses were plundered and injured in like manner.
Some of the mob were armed with swords, some with clubs,
and some with axes. The outrages, if possible, were even
worse than those some months before. One man cut Mary
Turner’s bible into fragments with his axe. Another swore he
would beat out Mrs. Sheldon’s brains with her fire shovel.
Joshua Constable was attacked by an outrageous gang, his
house, in part, pulled down, his goods destroyed and stolen,
and his wife violently and brutally assaulted. For six days,
in the early part of 1744, this lawless riot lasted, and the
damage done to the property of the Wednesbury Methodists
amounted to a serious sum. Applications for redress were
made to not fewer than three magistrates, but to no purpose.
The document, containing many of the above facts, was
drawn up on February 26, 1744 when the persecuted
Methodists remark:—“We keep meeting together morning
and evening, are in great peace and love with each other,
and are nothing terrified by our adversaries. God grant we
may endure to the end!”<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>Leaving the “black country,” we must pass to other scenes
of fiendish violence, and yet sacred triumph.</p>

<p>Cornwall, at this period, was as imbruted as Staffordshire.
Smuggling was considered an honourable traffic, and the
plunder of shipwrecked mariners was accounted a lawful prize.
Drunkenness was general; and cockfighting, bullbaiting,
wrestling, and hurling were the favourite amusements of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
people. Francis Truscott relates that, at the time when the
Wesleys first went to Cornwall, there was a village, about five
miles from Helstone, which was literally without a Bible, and
which had, no religious book whatever, except a single copy of
the Book of Common Prayer, kept at the public house. On
one occasion, during a terrific storm, when the people feared
that the world was ending, they fled in consternation to the
tavern, that Tom, the tapster, might secure them protection by
reading them a prayer. Having fallen upon their knees, Tom
hastily snatched a well thumbed book; and began, with great
pomposity, to read about storms, wrecks, and rafts, until his
mistress, finding that some mistake was made, cried out,
“Tom, that is ‘Robin Cruso’!” “No,” said Tom, “it is
the Prayer-Book;” and on he went until he came to a description
of man Friday, when his mistress again vociferated
that she was certain Tom was reading “Robin Cruso.”
“Well, well,” said Tom, “suppose I am; there are as good
prayers in ‘Robin Cruso’ as in any other book”; and so Tom
proceeded, till the storm abated, and the conscience stricken
company dispersed, complacently believing that they had
done their duty.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>While the people, however, were thus generally sunk in
ignorance and vice, there were a few exceptions. Among
these were Catherine Quick and eleven others, at St. Ives,
who frequently met together to pray, and to read Burkitt’s
Notes on the New Testament. This godly band of pious
people was visited by Captain Turner, a Methodist from
Bristol; and this led Catherine Quick and her associates to
invite Wesley to visit them.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>Charles Wesley was the first to come. Entering St. Ives,
on July 16, Mr. Shepherd met him; the boys of the place
gave him a rough salute; and Mr. Nance made him his
welcome guest. The day after his arrival, he went to church,
where the rector preached a railing sermon against the
Methodists, or, as he called them, “the new sect, enemies
to the Church, seducers, troublers, scribes, pharisees, and
hypocrites.” Immediately after being thus religiously regaled,
Charles and his godly inviters went to the church at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
Wednock, where Mr. Hoblin, the curate, poured out such a
hotch-potch of railing and foolish lies as might have made
even the devil blush. Charles told the preacher, that he had
been misinformed; upon which his reverence replied, with
more coarseness than courtesy, “You are a liar,” and then
left him. On the day following, when Charles Wesley went
to the market house, at St. Ives, and commenced singing the
hundredth psalm, the mob began to beat a drum and shout.
Four days later, when he had just named his text, the same
unruly ruffians rushed upon his congregation, and threatened
to murder them. The sconces of the room were broken,
the windows dashed in pieces, and the shutters, benches,
and, indeed, everything except the walls, destroyed. They
asseverated, that Charles Wesley should not preach again,
and lifted up their hands and clubs to strike him. The
women were beaten, dragged about, and trampled on without
mercy; until, at length, the rascals fell to quarreling
among themselves, broke the town clerk’s head, and left the
room. Two days after, while preaching at Wednock, the
minister’s mob fell upon the congregation, and <i>swore</i> most
horribly, that they would be revenged on them for their
taking the people from the church, and making such a disturbance
on the sabbath day. Sticks and stones were used,
and ten cowardly ruffians attacked one unarmed man, beat
him with their clubs, and knocked him to the ground. The
day following, at St. Ives, the service was broken up by the
mob throwing eggs and stones, and swearing they would pull
down the walls of the room, whose windows, benches, and
sconces they had already ruthlessly destroyed. At Pool, on
July 26, the churchwarden shouted, and hallooed, and put his
hat to Charles Wesley’s mouth to prevent his preaching.</p>

<p>All these outrages were principally prompted by the parsons,
who continually spoke of the Methodists as popish emissaries,
and who, to use the Rev. Mr. Hoblin’s fisticuff language,
“ought to be driven away by blows, and not by arguments.”
At length, the mayor of St. Ives appointed twenty new constables
to suppress the rioters by force of arms, “and plainly
told Mr. Hoblin, the fire and fagot minister, that he would
not be perjured to gratify any man’s malice.”</p>

<p>Charles Wesley came to St. Ives on the 16th of July, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
set out, on his return to London, on August 8, his brother
having summoned him to attend a conference with the
adherents of Whitefield and with the Moravians. In this
way, his labours in Cornwall were interrupted; but, a fortnight
after, his brother, accompanied by John Nelson, John
Downes, and Mr. Shepherd, succeeded him. Nelson and
Downes had but one horse between them, and, hence, rode by
turns. They reached St. Ives on August 30, and found the
society increased to about a hundred and twenty, nearly a
hundred of whom had found peace with God. John Nelson
began to work at his trade as a stonemason; and, as opportunity
permitted, preached at St. Just, the Land’s End,
and other places. John Downes fell ill of a fever, and was
unable to preach at all. Wesley and Nelson slept upon the
floor, Wesley using Nelson’s top coat for a pillow, and Nelson
using Burkitt’s Notes on the New Testament for his. One
morning, at three o’clock, after using this hard bed for a
fortnight, Wesley turned over, clapped Nelson on the side,
and jocosely said: “Brother Nelson, let us be of good cheer,
for the skin is off but one side yet.” Their board also was
as hard as their bed. They were continually preaching; but
“it was seldom,” says Nelson, “that any one asked us to eat
or drink. One day, as we returned from St. Hilary Downs,
Mr. Wesley stopped his horse to pick the blackberries, saying,
‘Brother Nelson, we ought to be thankful, that there are
plenty of blackberries; for this is the best country I ever saw
for getting an appetite, but the worst for getting food.’”<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>Wesley spent three weeks in Cornwall, leaving Nelson
behind him. Upon the whole, he had been kindly treated.
The mob at St. Ives, it is true, welcomed him with a loud
huzza; and serenaded him before his window with the harmless
ditty:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Charles Wesley is come to town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To try if he can pull the churches down.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, during his stay, the only act of violence he met with
was, on one occasion, when the mob burst into the room at
St. Ives, and a ruffian struck him on the head.</p>

<p>On his way to Cornwall, and also on returning, Wesley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
preached at Exeter, and visited a lad, and a clergyman in
prison, both sentenced to suffer death. His vast congregation
“in that solemn amphitheatre,” as he calls the castle yard, was
such an one as he had rarely seen,—“void both of anger, fear,
and love.” He also preached at the cross in Taunton, where
a man, attempting to make disturbance, so exasperated the
congregation, that there was a general cry, “Knock the rascal
down, beat out his brains!” and Wesley had to interfere to
prevent his being roughly handled. He likewise paid a flying
visit to the Isles of Scilly, crossing the ocean in a fishing boat,
and singing amid the swelling waves:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When passing through the watery deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I ask in faith His promised aid;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waves an awful distance keep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shrink from my devoted head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fearless their violence I dare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They cannot harm,—for God is there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has been already stated, that Charles Wesley was summoned
from Cornwall to attend a conference in London,
consisting of the leading men of the three communities,—the
Arminian Methodists, the Calvinistic Methodists, and the
Moravians. The object of the conference was, by mutual
explanations and concessions, to cultivate a better understanding
with each other; so that the parties might avoid all
unnecessary collision, and unite, as far as was practicable,
in advancing what they believed to be the work of God.
Wesley drew up a statement of the questions at issue
between himself and Whitefield, with the concessions he was
prepared to make.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Mr. Jackson says, the project had its
origin with Wesley,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> and perhaps it had; but, a year before
this, John Cennick expressed a wish for the same sort of
meeting. In a letter to Whitefield’s wife, dated May 6, 1742,
he writes:—“I have had it much impressed upon my mind,
that it would be right in the sight of God, that all our
preachers, all Mr. Wesley’s, and all the Moravian brethren
should meet together. Who knows but we might unite? Or
if not, we might consent in principles as far as we can, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
love one another. At least, I think all <i>our</i> preachers should
meet, as the apostles did, often. I know it would be for good;
but I suspend my judgment to the elder brethren.”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>It may thus be doubtful whether the proposal for the conference
originated with Wesley or with Cennick; but, through
no fault of Wesley’s, the proposal was abortive. To be
present at the conference, Wesley travelled from Newcastle;
his brother came all the way from Cornwall; and John Nelson
trudged from Yorkshire. But Whitefield, who was in London,
seems to have declined the invitation; the Moravians refused
to come; and, though Spangenberg had promised to attend,
he left England instead of doing so; while James Hutton said,
his brethren had orders not to confer at all, unless the archbishop
of Canterbury, or the bishop of London, were also
present.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>This was the last attempt at union; but perhaps it
suggested to Wesley’s mind the idea of having conferences
of his own, which he began to hold twelve months afterwards.</p>

<p>Not a little of the time of the two Wesleys was now
employed in pastoralizing the societies they had formed in
London, Bristol, and other places. In Bristol, in the month
of January, Wesley spoke to each member of society, and
rejoiced in finding them neither barren nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. He did the same at
Kingswood, and remarks: “I cannot understand how any
minister can hope ever to give up his account with joy, unless
(as Ignatius advises) he knows all his flock by name; not
overlooking the men servants and maid servants.” In London,
he and his brother began visiting the society together, on
February 2, which they continued from six in the morning
to six at night, until the visiting was completed. The same
practice was pursued at Newcastle.</p>

<p>The London society now consisted of nineteen hundred and
fifty members; and, before the year was ended, it numbered
two and twenty hundred. This was a large church, gathered
within the last four years, and needing a more than ordinary
amount of pastoral attention. The members only, to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
nothing of children, servants, and outside hearers, were almost
sufficient to fill the Foundery chapel twice over. More room
became imperative. Without this, it seemed to be impossible
to extend, or even to conserve the work. London had one
Methodist chapel already; before the year was ended, it had
two others.</p>

<p>In the month of May, Wesley had the offer of a chapel
in West Street, Seven Dials, which about sixty years before
had been built by the French Protestants. He accepted the
offer, and opened the chapel, as a Methodist place of worship,
on Trinity Sunday, the first service lasting from ten
o’clock till three. At five, he preached again to an immense
congregation at the Great Gardens; then met the leaders;
and after them the bands; and yet, at ten o’clock at night,
he was less weary than when he began his enormous day’s
work in the morning. Here, when in London, he and his
brother now regularly officiated on Sunday mornings and
evenings, read the liturgy, and administered the sacraments.
The Lord’s supper was celebrated at the morning service on
both the first and second Sundays of the month, and the
attendance was so numerous, that, in both instances, the
service usually lasted at least five hours. This was longer
than even Wesley thought desirable, and led him to divide
the communicants into three divisions, so that not more than
about six hundred might communicate on the same occasion.
These were enormous gatherings, with which those of the
present day will hardly bear comparison.</p>

<p>Three months after he took possession of the West Street
chapel, Wesley became the occupier of a third, which had
been built in Bermondsey, Southwark, by a Unitarian. Being
vacant, Wesley took it. Some objected to this. “What!”
said a zealous woman, “what! will Mr. Wesley preach at
Snowsfields? Surely not! there is not such another place in
London. The people there are not men, but devils!” This
was just the sort of reason to induce Wesley, not to stay away,
but go. Accordingly, on August 8, he opened Snowsfields
chapel by preaching from the words—“Jesus said, They
that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</p>

<p>Wesley did more than this for the London society.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
Visiting the sick he regarded as an imperative Christian
duty. Sending them help was not enough. Besides, to
neglect this was not only to neglect a duty, but to lose a
means of grace. “One great reason,” says Wesley, “why
the rich have so little sympathy for the poor, is, because they
so seldom visit them.” “All,” he adds, “who desire to escape
the everlasting fire, and to inherit the everlasting kingdom,
are equally concerned, according to their power, to practise
this important duty.”<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Holding such sentiments, Wesley
himself, throughout life, visited the poor and the afflicted, to
the utmost of his ability; but, of course, as an itinerant evangelist,
when he had done his best, much was left untouched.
Hence, in the year 1743, he appointed in London visitors of
the sick, as distinct office bearers in his society.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Stewards
had been appointed already, to receive the contributions of
the society, which amounted to nearly £8 per week; and to
distribute them, partly in repairing and paying for chapel
premises, partly in paying debts, partly in other necessary
expenses, and partly in relieving the afflicted and the poor.
The stewards, seven in number, were to be frugal; to have
no long accounts; to give none, that asked relief, either an ill
word or an ill look; and to expect no thanks from man.
They met together every Thursday morning at six o’clock,
and distributed all the money paid to them up to the previous
Tuesday night; so that all receipts and disbursements were
concluded within the week. The stewards, however, soon
found a difficulty with regard to the afflicted. Some were
ready to perish before they heard of them; and, even when
they became acquainted with their illness, being persons
generally employed in trade, they were unable to visit them
as often as they wished. To meet this deficiency, Wesley
called together the whole of the London society; showed
how impossible it was for the stewards to visit all the sick
in all parts of the metropolis; desired the leaders to be
more careful in inquiring after sick cases, and in giving early
information concerning them; and then appealed to the
assembled members and asked for volunteers for this important
work. Numbers cheerfully responded, out of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
Wesley selected forty-six, whom he judged to be of the most
tender, loving spirit. He then divided London into twenty-three
districts, and arranged that the sick, in each district,
should be visited, by a couple of visitors, three times every
week; and that the visitors, besides inquiring into the state
of the people’s souls, should relieve those of them in want,
and should present their accounts to the stewards weekly.
Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon reflection, I saw how exactly, in this also, we had copied after
the primitive church. What were the ancient deacons? What was
Phœbe, the deaconess, but such a visitor of the sick?”</p>
</div>

<p>Four rules were to be observed:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. Be plain and open in dealing with souls. 2. Be mild, tender,
patient. 3. Be cleanly in all you do for the sick. 4. Be not nice.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley adds, five years afterwards:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have ever since had great reason to praise God for His continued
blessing on this undertaking. Many lives have been saved, many sicknesses
healed, much pain and want prevented or removed. Many heavy
hearts have been made glad, many mourners comforted; and the visitors
have found, from Him whom they serve, a present reward for all their
labour.”<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The two thousand members of the London society contributed
about £400 a year, or, at the rate of a shilling per
member per quarter. The Bristol society consisted of seven
hundred members, and, after the same ratio, would contribute
£140 per year. Eight hundred members at Newcastle would
raise £160; and the societies at Kingswood and other places
might give £100 additional: thus making the Methodist
income, for 1743, something like £800. Out of this, all chapel
expenses had to be defrayed; a large proportion was given to
the afflicted poor; something was necessary for the contingent
expenses of Wesley’s helpers; and the remainder,—how
much was it?—was perhaps given to the two Wesleys to
meet some of their own necessary wants. These were the
men preying upon the pockets of the poor, and making themselves
a fortune out of other people’s money! Such falsehoods
were current, and were not entirely disbelieved even by
some of Wesley’s own relatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span></p>

<p>Poor Emily Wesley, a classical scholar, and no mean poet,—after
teaching in a boarding school where she was ill used and
worse paid, and after marrying a poor Quaker, who did little
for her, and soon left her—was now a penniless and dependent
widow, maintained entirely by her two brothers, and living at
the Foundery. Emily, in a petulant humour, wrote to her
brother John, accusing him of the want of kindness and of
natural affection, notwithstanding his reputed riches. John, in
reply, wrote one of his most pungent letters, of which the
following is a copy:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, <i>June 30, 1743</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Emily</span>,—Once, I think, I told you my mind freely before; I
am constrained to do so once again. You say, ‘From the time of my
coming to London, till last Christmas, you would not do me the least
kindness.’ Do I dream, or you? Whose house were you in for three
months, and upwards? By whose money were you sustained? It is a
poor case, that I am forced to mention these things.</p>

<p>“But, ‘I would not take you lodgings in fifteen weeks.’ No, nor should
I have done in fifteen years. I never once imagined, that you expected
<i>me</i> to do this! Shall I leave the word of God to serve tables? You
should know I have quite other things to mind; temporal things I shall
mind less and less.</p>

<p>“‘When I was removed you never concerned yourself about me.’ That
is not the fact. What my brother does, I do. Besides, I myself spoke to
you abundance of times, before Christmas last.</p>

<p>“‘When I was at preaching, you would scarce speak to me.’ Yes;
at least as much as to my sister Wright, or, indeed, as I did to any else
at those times.</p>

<p>“‘I impute all your unkindness to one principle you hold, that natural
affection is a great weakness, if not a sin.’ What is this principle I hold?
That natural affection is a sin? or that adultery is a virtue? or that Mahommed
was a prophet of God? and that Jesus Christ was a son of Belial?
You may as well impute <i>all</i> these principles to me as <i>one</i>. I hold one
just as much as the other. O Emmy, never let that idle, senseless accusation
come out of your mouth.</p>

<p>“Do you hold that principle, ‘that we ought to be just (<i>i. e.</i> pay our
debts) before we are merciful’? If I held it, I should not give one shilling
for these two years, either to you or any other. And, indeed, I have, for
some time, stayed my hand; so that I give next to nothing, except what
I give to my relations. And I am often in doubt with regard to that, not
whether natural affection be not a sin; but whether it ought to supersede
common justice. You know nothing of my temporal circumstances, and
the straits I am in, almost continually; so that were it not for the reputation
of my great riches, I could not stand one week.</p>

<p>“I have now done with myself, and have only a few words concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
you. You are of all creatures the most unthankful to God and man. I
stand amazed at you. How little have you profited under such means of
improvement! Surely whenever your eyes are opened, whenever you see
your own tempers, with the advantages you have enjoyed, you will make
no scruple to pronounce yourself, (whores and murderers not excepted,)
the very chief of sinners.—I am, etc.,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This is a caustic letter; and yet John Wesley was a loving
brother. For nearly thirty years afterwards, Emily Harper
was a resident in the preachers’ house at West Street, was a
constant attendant on the ministry of her brothers, and died
in peace, at the age of eighty, about the year 1772.</p>

<p>Much has been already related respecting the Methodist
persecutions of 1743; but the whole has not been told. At
Newcastle, three Dissenting ministers agreed together to
exclude all from the holy communion, who would not refrain
from attending Wesley’s ministry. One of them publicly
affirmed, that the Methodist preachers were all papists, and
that their doctrine was Popery. Another preached against
them, and said, “Many texts in the Bible are for them;
but you ought not to mind these texts; for the papists have
put them in.” At Cowbridge, in Wales, when Wesley attempted
to preach, the mob shouted, cursed, blasphemed,
and threw showers of stones almost without intermission.
At Bristol, a clergyman preached, in several of the city
churches, against the <i>upstart</i> Methodists; and was about to
do so in the church of St. Nicholas, when, after naming his
text, he was seized with a rattling in his throat, fell backward
against the pulpit door, and, on the Sunday following,
expired. At Egham, Wesley went to church, and listened
to one of the most miserable sermons he ever heard; stuffed
with dull, senseless, improbable lies against those whom the
parson complimented with the title of “false prophets.”</p>

<p>At Sheffield, the ministers of the town so inflamed the
people, that they were ready to tear the Methodists to pieces.
An army officer drew his sword, and presented it at Charles
Wesley’s breast. The meeting-house was ruthlessly demolished,
and the mob encouraged by the constable. The
windows of Mr. Bennett’s house, in which Charles Wesley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
lodged, were smashed to atoms; and stones flew thick and
fast in all directions. Near Barley Hall, a few miles from
Sheffield, Charles Wesley and David Taylor were assaulted
with a storm of stones, eggs, and dirt; David was wounded
in the head and lost his hat; and the clothes of his companion
were besmeared with filth.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>At Hampton, in Gloucestershire, the mob threatened to
make aprons of Whitefield’s gown; broke a young lady’s
arm; threw Mr. Adams twice into a pool of water; seized
Whitefield for the purpose of casting him into a pit of lime;<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
and, from four in the afternoon till midnight, continued rioting,
and declaring that no Anabaptists, etc., should preach
there, upon pain of being first put into a skin-pit, and afterwards
into a brook. Women were pulled down the stairs by
the hair of their heads; Mr. Williams was twice thrown into
a hole full of noisome reptiles and stagnant water, and was
beaten, and dragged along the kennel; while the Methodists,
in general, were mobbed to such an extent, that many expected
to be murdered, and hid themselves in holes and
corners, to avoid their enemies.</p>

<p>All this was bad enough; but there was something else,
perhaps, quite as painful. The press, in its attacks, became
as virulent as ever. Among other publications issued, was
the following: “The Notions of the Methodists fully disproved,
with a Vindication of the Clergy of the Church of
England from their Aspersions. In two Letters to the Rev.
Mr. John Wesley. Newcastle: 1743.” In this precious
morsel, of near a hundred pages, the Methodists are branded
as “conceited, vain boasters,” and “ignorant, giddy, presumptuous
enthusiasts.” Wesley is accused of “compassing sea
and land to gain proselytes”; of “making unwarrantable
dissensions in the Church”; and of “prejudicing the people,
wherever he came, against his brethren the clergy.” “You
are,” writes this northern pamphleteer, “guilty both of schism
and rebellion, which are two very grievous and damnable
sins. You are the sower and ringleader of dissension, endeavouring
with unwearied assiduity to set the flock at variance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
with their ministers and each other. You assume to yourself
great wisdom and high attainments in all spiritual knowledge;
but it requires no depth of understanding, to judge
whether your character and conduct suit that of the spiritually
or carnally wise man in St. James. You scruple not
to accuse the clergy of almost universally teaching devilish
doctrine, and of being deceitful workers; but, however you
may boast of your conversions, you will in the end render
yourselves the ridicule of mankind. You go from one end
of the nation to another, lamenting the heresies of your
brethren, and instilling into the people’s minds, that they are
led into errors by their pastors; when the truth is, you are
perverting them with solifidian and antinomian blasphemies.
Consider, sir, how wicked and abominable in the sight of
God it is for you to misrepresent your brethren to the
people, in this scandalous manner. The mischief is, the
giddy multitude, like the Athenians, love to spend their
time in nothing else but hearing some new thing. They are
tired with the solid, plain, and rational way of preaching
they have been accustomed to in the Church, and think it
dry and insipid in comparison of the powerful charms of that
ecstatic eloquence, those highflown metaphors, those pretty
rhymes, those taking gestures, with which you tickle and
bewitch them. You give a deplorable account of the debt
you have contracted by the building of your meeting-houses;
but unless you can bring better proof than you have hitherto
done, of the necessity there is to give yourself all this trouble
and expense, all wise and considerate men, without any
breach of charity, will look upon subscriptions for carrying
on your designs, as little less than picking the poor people’s
pockets, and robbing them of that which should maintain
their families.”</p>

<p>Such is a specimen of the malignant slanders cast upon
Wesley by this northern clergyman.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that the Rev. Henry Piers
preached, in 1742, before the clergy of the deanery of Shoreham,
a visitation sermon, which Wesley revised, and which,
at the time of its delivery, gave great offence. The preacher
chosen for this office, in 1743, was of another stamp; and
his sermon also was published, with the following title: “Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
Speaking as the Oracles of God. A Sermon, preached before
the Reverend the Clergy of the Deanery of Shoreham, at the
Visitation, held in the Parish Church of Farningham, on
Thursday, May 19, 1743. By John Andrews, M.A., Vicar
of that Church.” 8vo, 30 pages. The world would have sustained
no loss, if Mr. Andrews’ sermon had not been printed.
The preacher sneers at the fancies of theological empirics, in
one paragraph, and, in the next, speaks of the doctrines of
“justification and regeneration as questions and strifes of
words, which profit not.” Mr. Piers’ visitation sermon is attacked
on the subject of faith; and the assembled clergy of
the deanery of Shoreham are officially informed, that “every
one, that is rightly and duly baptized, not only receives the
outward ordinance, but the inward and spiritual grace annexed
to it.”</p>

<p>Another pamphlet, published at this period, was, “A Fine
Picture of Enthusiasm, chiefly drawn by Dr. Scott; with an
application to our modern Methodists.” 40 pages. Dedicated
to the Bishop of London. In this miserable <i>morceau</i>, we are
told, that “there are thousands flocking after those enthusiasts,
Whitefield and Wesley, who appear to be deluding
crowds of people into a passionate, mechanical religion.”
One of them, at least, is suspected to be a masked Jesuit;
and both have courted persecution, but have had a mortifying
disappointment. The singing of the Methodists is enchanting,
and their tunes the most melodious that ever were composed
for church music; but their hymns are irrational, and,
like their prayers, dwell upon a word, or are immediate addresses
to the Son of God, and represent Him as much more
compassionate to the human race than God the Father ever
was. “One of these artful teachers,” says the writer, “has
ordered the tickets for his people to be impressed with the
crucifix; and this, with their <i>confessions</i> and other customs,
intimates a manifest fondness for the orthodox institutions
of the Church of Rome. These <i>modest</i> teachers have not
failed to trumpet their own extraordinary piety and holiness,
as well as their extraordinary knowledge and illumination;
and this has been done with great effect among the people.
Their doctrine has very generally occasioned disorder in the
passions of their hearers; the screamings and convulsions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
common among them, in their public assemblies, being called
convictions. Vast numbers have gone melancholy among
them. Many have been led to quit their lawful and necessary
employment; to neglect their husbands, children, and
families; and from useful members in society have become
mopes and visionaries, incapable of pursuing their proper
business, or of supporting themselves with decency.”</p>

<p>A fourth publication, belonging to the year 1743, was “The
Progress of Methodism in Bristol; or, the Methodist Unmasked:
wherein the doctrines, discipline, policy, divisions,
and successes of that novel sect are fully detected and
properly displayed in Hudibrastick verse, by an Impartial
Hand. To which is added, by way of appendix, the Paper-Controversy
between Mr. Robert Williams, supported by
Thomas Christie, Esq., Recorder of Savannah, and the Rev.
Mr. Wesley, supported only by his own integrity and assurance.
Together with authentic extracts, taken from a late
narrative of the state of Georgia, relating to the conduct of
that gentleman during his abode in that colony. Bristol:
1743.” 16mo, 72 pages.</p>

<p>Among other things, this mendacious pamphlet contains an
affidavit, sworn by Robert Williams before Stephen Clutterbuck,
Mayor of Bristol, to the effect, that two freeholders at
Savannah became bail for Wesley’s appearance at the sessions
to take his trial, and that he dishonourably escaped from the
colony and left his bondsmen in the lurch. To this Wesley
replied: “Captain Robert Williams, you know in your own
soul, that every word of this is a pure invention, without one
grain of truth from the beginning of it to the end. What
amends can you ever make, either to God, or to me, or to the
world? Into what a dreadful dilemma have you brought
yourself! You must either openly retract an open slander, or
you must wade through thick and thin to support it, till that
God, to whom I appeal, shall maintain His own cause, and
sweep you away from the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Whitefield and Wesley, in this scurrilous production, are
accused of preaching to get money, and of placing men
with plates at each gate and stile of the fields in which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
harangued the people, to gather collections for the Orphan
House in Georgia and the Room in Bristol. Wesley is charged
with pretending to work miracles; for, upon a company of
women falling down before him, he first of all prays over
them, then sings a hymn, and then exorcises devils. In the
midst of a most severe winter, he had taken his converts,
early in the morning, through frost and snow, to the river
Froom, at Baptist Mills, where, on the ice being broken, he
and they went into the water, where, with “limbs shuddering
and teeth <i>hackering</i>,” he baptized or dipped them. Class-meetings
are described, the leaders of which note the sins of
those who confess to them, register them in a book, and, in
due season, “report them to John, who admonishes one, reprimands
another, and expels a third.” At first, each member
gave a penny, but now the <i>lowest</i> payment was twopence
weekly. At present there were forty-eight classes in Bristol,
each class containing “an even dozen.” After the watchnight
meetings at Kingswood,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Men, boys, and girls, and women too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come strolling home at morning two:”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and at the nightly lovefeasts, “the ghostly father and all his
sons draw near—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The pious sisters, wives, and misses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And greet them well with holy kisses.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But enough of this. What did Wesley himself publish in
1743?</p>

<p>1. “Nature, Design, and General Rules of the United
Societies, in London, Bristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Newcastle-upon-Tyne: printed by John Gooding,
on the Side. Price one penny. 1743.” Twelve pages.</p>

<p>This, the first edition of the “Rules,” is signed by John
Wesley only, and bears date February 23, 1743. A second
edition was issued, signed by both John and Charles Wesley,
and dated May 1, 1743. The first edition has annexed “A
Prayer for those who are convinced of Sin,” consisting of
eighteen stanzas of four lines each, and from which is taken
the beautiful hymn, numbered 462, in the Wesleyan Hymn-Book,
and beginning with the line, “O let the prisoners’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span> mournful cries”; a production admirably appropriate to the
circumstances in which the members of the first Methodist
societies were placed.</p>

<p>Societies cannot exist without rules. Up to the present,
Wesley had regulated his societies by <i>vivâ voce</i> instructions
and direct authority; but, as the Methodists increased and
multiplied, this became more difficult, and hence the publication
now mentioned. The Rules were both written and
published at Newcastle upon Tyne. Eleven days after the
date they bear, Wesley read them to the Newcastle society,
and desired the members seriously to consider whether they
were willing to observe them. The careful reader will remark
the designation which Wesley gives to his societies, as well
as his description of their “nature and design.” They are
not “Wesleyan,” or “Methodist,” but “United Societies.”
As compared with the rules now in use, there are a few
variations in the original edition deserving of being noticed.
For instance, in the list of the leader’s duties, the first in
order was, to receive from each person in his class, once a
week, what the members were willing to give toward <i>the
relief of the poor</i>. This is now altered thus: “to receive what
they are willing to give for the <i>support of the gospel</i>.” The
present rule forbidding “<i>brother</i> going to law <i>with brother</i>,” in
the first and several subsequent editions, simply read, “going
to law.” To the original rule, “the giving or taking things
on usury,” has been added the words, “that is, unlawful
interest;” and to the rule prohibiting “uncharitable or unprofitable
conversation,” there was added, in the fourth edition,
published in 1744, “especially, speaking evil of ministers or
those in authority,” words now changed for “magistrates or
ministers.” In the list of things forbidden in the present
Rules, is the important one, “borrowing without a probability
of paying; or taking up goods without a probability
of paying for them;” this is not in the first editions. And
among the duties enjoined is “<i>family</i> and private prayer”;
but in the first edition the word <i>family</i> is not found, though,
in the fourth edition, published twelve months afterwards,
it was inserted.</p>

<p>The curious reader will forgive these trifles. They are all
the variations found in the first edition of the Rules, as com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>pared
with the Rules now in use. The Rules themselves are
too well known to require insertion.</p>

<p>2. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1743, was “A
Word in Season; or, Advice to a Soldier.” 12mo, six pages.
This is a model tract, and shows that, from the first, soldiers
excited Wesley’s sympathy.</p>

<p>3. “Thoughts on Marriage and Celibacy.” 12mo, twelve
pages. A strange production, substantially embodied in the
piece in Wesley’s collected works, entitled, “Thoughts on a
Single Life” (see vol. xxiv., page 252, orig. edit.). What shall
we say of this? Wesley admits, that the popish doctrine
forbidding to marry is a doctrine of devils, and that a person
may be as holy in a married as in a single state; but he
proceeds to show, that the happy few who have power to
abstain from marriage are free from a thousand nameless
domestic trials which are found sooner or later in every
family. They are at liberty from the greatest of all entanglements,
the loving one creature above all others; they have
leisure to improve themselves; and, having no wife or children
to provide for, may give all their worldly substance to God.
Those highly favoured celibates are exhorted to prize the
advantages they enjoy, and to be careful to keep them; they
are to avoid all needless conversation, much more all intimacy
with those of the other sex; all softness and effeminacy; all
delicacy and needless self indulgence; and all sloth, inactivity,
and indolence. They are to sleep no more than nature
requires; to use as much bodily exercise as they can; to fast,
and practise self denial; to wait upon the Lord without distraction;
and to give all their time and their money to God.
On the whole, without disputing whether the married or single
life is the more perfect state. Wesley concludes by adding,
“We may safely say, Blessed are they who abstain from things
lawful in themselves, in order to be more devoted to God.”</p>

<p>Thirty years afterwards, when Wesley was twitted for
marrying, after expressing such opinions, he averred, that his
opinions with regard to the advantages of a single life were
still unchanged; and that he entered the married state “for
reasons best known to himself.”<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> This was a lame reply to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
reasonable reflection on inconsistency. Wesley’s tract was
a mistake; or, if not, Wesley ought to have adopted his own
principles, and have lived and died a celibate.</p>

<p>4. In July, 1743, Wesley wrote his “Instructions for Children,”
which reached a second edition in 1745, 12mo, 38 pages.
Prefixed, was a preface, addressed “to all parents and
schoolmasters,” stating, that a great part of the tract was
translated from the French, and that it contained “the true
principles of the Christian education of children,” and that
these “should in all reason be instilled into them, as soon
as they can distinguish good from evil.”</p>

<p>The first twelve lessons are a catechism, respecting God,
the creation and the fall of man, man’s redemption, the means
of grace, hell, and heaven. Then follow lessons how to
regulate our desires, understanding, joy, and practices.</p>

<p>Repenting is defined as “being thoroughly convinced of
our sinfulness, guilt, and helplessness”; faith in Christ, as “a
conviction that Christ has loved <i>me</i> and given Himself for <i>me</i>;”
holiness, as “the love of God and of all mankind for God’s
sake.” Wesley asserts that “they who teach children to
love praise, train them for the devil”; and that “fathers
and mothers who give children everything they like, are the
worst enemies they have.”</p>

<p>Wesley considered these “Instructions for Children,” extracted
from Abbé Fleury and M. Poiret, superior, “for depth
of sense and plainness of language, to anything in the English
tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The Church Catechism he declared to be “utterly
improper for children of six or seven years old,” and thought
“it would be far better to teach them the short catechism,
prefixed to the ‘Instructions.’”<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> Accordingly, he requested
all his preachers to give children the “Instructions,” and to
encourage them in committing the book to memory; while
they themselves were to make it the subject of special study.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s attention to children is proverbial. “When I
was a child,” said Robert Southey, “I was in a house, in
Bristol, where Wesley was. On running downstairs before
him, with a beautiful little sister of my own, he overtook us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
on the landing, when he lifted my sister in his arms and
kissed her. Placing her on her feet again, he then put his
hand upon my head, and blessed me; and I feel,” continued
the bard, his eyes glistening with tears, and yet in a tone of
grateful and tender recollection, “I feel as though I had the
blessing of that good man upon me still.”<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>In Wesley’s well known sermon on “Family Religion,” he
lays it down that “the wickedness of children is generally
owing to the fault or neglect of their parents.” The souls of
children ought to be fed as often as their bodies. Methodists
are exhorted not to send their sons “to any of the large
public schools (for they are nurseries of all manner of wickedness),
but to a private school, kept by some pious man, who
endeavours to instruct a small number of children in religion
and learning together.” He raises the same objection to
“large boarding schools” for girls; for “in these seminaries,
the children teach one another pride, vanity, affectation,
intrigue, artifice, and, in short, everything which a Christian
woman ought not to learn.” He adds: “I never yet knew a
pious, sensible woman, that had been bred at a large boarding
school, who did not aver, one might as well send a young
maid to be bred in Drury Lane.”<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>This is sweeping language; but at that period it was not
without truth.</p>

<p>5. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1743, was, “A
Practical Treatise on Christian Perfection. Extracted from
a late author.” 12mo, 115 pages. This was an abridgment of
William Law’s pungent book, published in 1726.</p>

<p>6. Another was an abridgment of Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s
Progress,” 12mo, 49 pages, price fourpence. Little did
Wesley think that, within a hundred years, the whole of the
glorious dreamer’s immortal work would be sold for a fourth
of the price charged for his own fragment.</p>

<p>7. Wesley’s last, and most important work, which reached a
second edition in the year it was published, was “An Earnest
Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion,” 12mo, 53 pages.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span></p>

<p>This was a clarion cry which created greater consternation
than ever in the camp of Wesley’s enemies. First of all, he
describes religion—the faith by which it is attained—and its
reasonableness. Then, turning from those who do not receive
the Christian system to those who say they do, he charges
them, in the name of God, either to profess themselves
infidels, or to <i>be</i> Christians; either to cast off the Bible, or
their sins. “A common swearer, a sabbath breaker, a whoremonger,
a drunkard, who says he believes the Scripture is of
God, is a monster upon earth, the greatest contradiction to
his own, as well as to the reason of all mankind.” After
this, Wesley replies to the objections raised against Methodist
doctrines, and to the calumny, that he and his coadjutors
were papists in disguise, undermining the Church, and
making preaching the means of replenishing their purses.
It had been reported, that he received £1300 a year at
the Foundery only, over and above what he received from
Bristol, Kingswood, Newcastle, and other places. To this
he answers, that the moneys given by the Methodists never
come into his hands at all; but are received and expended
by the stewards, in relieving the poor, and in buying, erecting,
or repairing chapels; and that, so far from there being
any overplus when this was done, he himself, at this moment,
was in debt to the amount of £650, on account of the
meeting-houses in London, Bristol, and Newcastle. He
had “deliberately thrown up his ease, most of his friends,
his reputation, and that way of life which of all others was
most agreeable both to his natural temper and education;
he had toiled day and night, spent all his time and
strength, knowingly destroyed a firm constitution, and was
hastening into weakness, pain, diseases, death,—to gain a
debt of six or seven hundred pounds.” Then addressing
himself to his brother clergy, he asks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For what price will you preach eighteen or nineteen times every
week; and this throughout the year? What shall I give you to travel
seven or eight hundred miles, in all weathers, every two or three months?
For what salary will you abstain from all other diversions than the doing
good, and the praising God? I am mistaken if you would not prefer
strangling to such a life, even with thousands of gold and silver.</p>

<p>“I will now simply tell you my sense of these matters, whether you will
hear or whether you will forbear. Food and raiment I have; such food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
as I choose to eat, and such raiment as I choose to put on: I have a place
where to lay my head: I have what is needful for life and godliness:
and I apprehend this is all the world can afford. The kings of the earth
can give me no more. For as to gold and silver, I count it dung and
dross; I trample it under my feet; I esteem it just as the mire of the
streets. I desire it not; I seek it not; I only fear lest any of it should
cleave to me, and I should not be able to shake it off before my spirit
returns to God. I will take care (God being my helper), that none of the
accursed thing shall be found in my tents when the Lord calleth me
hence. Hear ye this, all you who have discovered the treasures which I
am to leave behind me; if I leave behind me £10,—above my debts and
my books, or what may happen to be due on account of them,—you and
all mankind bear witness against me, that I lived and died a thief and a
robber.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley kept his word; for, within twelve months of his
decease, he closed his cash-book with the following words,
written with a tremulous hand, so as to be scarcely legible:—“For
upwards of eighty-six years, I have kept my accounts
exactly; I will not attempt it any longer, being satisfied with
the continual conviction, that I save all I can, and give all I
can; that is, all I have.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744<br />

Age  41</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WESLEY spent more than half of the year 1744 in
London and its immediate neighbourhood. He made
about half-a-dozen visits to Bristol; and three months were
occupied in a tour to Cornwall, thence to Yorkshire and
Newcastle, and thence to London.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley spent the year in London, Bristol, Cornwall,
Staffordshire, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, at Newcastle,
Nottingham, Sheffield, and other intervening places.</p>

<p>Whitefield commenced the year with rejoicing over the
birth of his firstborn,—a boy expected to be a minister, and
publicly baptized in the Tabernacle, where thousands, on the
occasion, joined in singing a doggrel hymn, written by an
aged and doting widow. On the 8th of February, this infant
prodigy suddenly expired in the Bell Inn, Gloucester,
where Whitefield himself was born; and, after being taken to
the church in which Whitefield was baptized, first communicated,
and first preached, was then buried, Whitefield returning
to London deeply pondering the meaning of what he calls
“this blessed riddle.” The next four months were chiefly
spent in the metropolis; after which he and his wife repaired
to Plymouth for the purpose of sailing to America. Here
they were detained for several weeks, waiting for the convoy
in whose company the voyage was to be attempted. During
the interval, Whitefield preached in the town and neighbourhood
with great success, and was nearly murdered by a
villain, who beat him most unmercifully with his golden-headed
cane. At length, he set sail in company with nearly
one hundred and fifty ships; and, after not a few adventures,
landed in New England, at the end of October, but was so
extremely ill, that, for several weeks, he was almost incapable
of preaching. In point of fact, Whitefield preached but
very little, during the year 1744, except in London and in
Plymouth, and in their respective vicinities.</p>

<p>One of the chief events of 1744 was the threat of a French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
invasion. On the 15th of February, the king sent a message
to the houses of parliament, to the effect, that he had received
undoubted intelligence, that the eldest son of the pretender to
his crown was arrived in France, and that preparations were
being made to invade England.</p>

<p>Parliament replied, that they looked upon such a design
with the greatest indignation and abhorrence, and would use
every effort to frustrate and defeat so desperate and insolent
an attempt.</p>

<p>Great excitement followed. The coast was watched with
the utmost care. A double guard was mounted at the
Tower, and also at St. James’s. All military officers were
ordered to their posts of duty. Workmen in the king’s
yards were directed to wear arms and accoutrements, and to
be exercised every morning; and instructions were given to
the militia of the county of Kent, to assemble at the earliest
notice.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The Habeas Corpus act was suspended, and a
proclamation was issued for a general fast. All papists and
reputed papists were forbidden to remain within ten miles of
the cities of Westminster and London. The Earl of Barrymore
was arrested and committed to the Tower, on the charge
of enlisting men for the Pretender. Loyal addresses were
presented to the king by the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, by the merchants of London, by the convocation
of the province of Canterbury, by the Quakers, by the
Protestant Dissenters, and by many others. The city of
Dublin offered a reward of £6000 for apprehending the Pretender,
or his son, either alive or dead, should they attempt
to land in Ireland; and sixty thousand fire arms and accoutrements
were seized in suspected houses in the southern parts
of that island. War was declared against France on the
29th of March, and the whole kingdom seemed to be inflamed
with martial ardour.</p>

<p>How did this affect Wesley? Two days after the king
informed parliament of the threatened invasion, Wesley and
his London society held a day of solemn fasting and prayer.
When the proclamation was published requiring all papists to
leave London, though he had appointed to go out of town, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
determined to stay, so as to cut off all occasion of reproach;
but on the 2nd of March (the last day mentioned in the
proclamation), while he was at a house in Spitalfields, a
magistrate and the parish officers came in search of papists.
Wesley was glad of the opportunity to explain the principles
and the practices of the Methodists. The searchers were
satisfied, and Wesley was allowed to depart in peace, a large
mob merely gaping, staring, and hallooing as loud as they
were able. Some of his friends pressed him to write an
address to the king, on behalf of the Methodists. He did so,
and described them as “a people scattered and peeled, and
trodden underfoot; traduced as inclined to Popery, and consequently
disaffected to his majesty.” They were, however,
“a part of the Protestant Church established in these kingdoms;
they detested the fundamental doctrines of the Church
of Rome; and were steadily attached to his majesty’s royal
person and illustrious house, and ready to obey him to the
uttermost, in all things which they conceived to be agreeable
to the written word of God.” “Silver and gold,” he adds,
“most of us must own, we have none; but such as we have
we humbly beg your majesty to accept, together with our
hearts and prayers.” Charles Wesley objected to the sending
of this address <i>in the name of the Methodists</i>, because
it would constitute them a sect, or at least would <i>seem to
allow</i> that they were a body distinct from the national
Church. He wished his brother to guard against this, and
then, in the name of the Lord, to address the king.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Upon
further consideration the address was laid aside.</p>

<p>Wesley’s troubles were not ended. On the 20th of March,
he received a summons from the Surrey magistrates, to appear
at the court at St. Margaret’s Hill. He did so, and asked,
“Has any one anything to lay to my charge?” None replied;
but, at length, one of the magistrates said, “Sir, are you
willing to take the oaths to his majesty, and to sign the
declaration against Popery?” Wesley replied, “I am”;
which he did accordingly, and was permitted to depart in
peace.</p>

<p>Why was this? Besides the general calumny cast upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
the Methodists, that they were papists, it was at this time
currently reported, that Wesley had recently been seen with
the Pretender in France. Might not this be the reason of
the unnecessary and annoying summons to appear at St.
Margaret’s Hill?</p>

<p>In the same month, a warrant was issued, by a magistrate
of the west riding of Yorkshire, to compel the attendance
of five witnesses to give evidence at Wakefield, that they
had heard Charles Wesley speak “treasonable words, as
praying for the banished, or for the Pretender.” At the
time appointed, March 15, Charles himself appeared in
the magisterial court, and engaged to prove, that all the
Methodists, “to a man, were true members of the Church
of England, and loyal subjects of his majesty, King George”;
and then desired their worships to administer to him the
oaths. All the summoned witnesses retracted their accusations;
and yet the Methodist itinerant was insulted at the
door of the magistrates’ room, for eight long hours, when Mr.
justice Burton, with consummate coolness, told him he might
go, for they had nought against him. “Sir,” said Charles,
“that is not sufficient: I cannot depart till my character is
cleared. It is no trifling matter. Even my life is concerned
in the charge.” At length, their worships reluctantly
acknowledged, in explicit terms, that his “loyalty was unquestionable”;
and he took his leave for Birstal, where the
Methodists of the neighbourhood met him on a hill, and
joined him in singing “praises lustily, and with a good
courage.” All this arose out of one of the witnesses having
heard him praying, on the 12th of February, that “the Lord
would call home His banished”; the words being used, of
course, in a sense purely spiritual.</p>

<p>Other inconveniences and acts of violence arose out of the
threatened invasion of the French. John Slocomb, a poor
baker’s boy, who was now one of Wesley’s preachers in
Cornwall, was arrested, under a press warrant, and taken by
his own uncle to prison, where he was kept a week, and then
brought before the commissioners, who, finding no cause to
punish or detain him, were obliged, at last, notwithstanding
all their threatenings, to let him go. In Nottingham, two
other preachers, John Healey and Thomas Westall, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
similarly arrested, the magistrates demanding their horses for
the king’s service, and refusing to believe they had none till
they sent and searched. The case of John Nelson is known
to every one, and will ever stand as one of the most sublime
and tragic chapters in Methodistic history. John Downes,
another itinerant, while preaching at Epworth, was seized and
pressed for the king’s service, and sent as a prisoner to
Lincoln gaol. And then, to all these must be added the
mournful case of Thomas Beard, a quiet and peaceable man,
who was torn from his trade, and wife and children, in Yorkshire,
and sent away as a soldier, for no other crime, either
committed or pretended, than that of calling sinners to
repentance; and who, while lodged in the hospital at
Newcastle, died; and, as one of the first martyrs among the
Methodists, escaped from his cruel enemies on earth, to the
company of the beatified in heaven.</p>

<p>Thus did the hot-headed friends of King George II.
do their utmost to make leal Methodists disloyal to the
throne and house of Hanover; but the effort failed; for, from
first to last, more faithful subjects than Wesley’s followers the
throne of England has never had. “It is my religion,” wrote
Wesley, more than thirty years after this, “which obliges
me to put men in mind to be subject to principalities and
powers. Loyalty is with me an essential branch of religion,
and which I am sorry any Methodist should forget. There is
the closest connection, therefore, between my religious and
political conduct; the selfsame authority enjoining me to
fear God, and to honour the king.”<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>Two events occurred, in the year 1744, which deserve special
mention: the first Methodist conference, and Wesley’s last
university sermon.</p>

<p>The conference began on Monday, June 25, and continued
the five following days. It was held at the Foundery, London;
and consisted of the two Wesleys, and four other clergymen,
namely, John Hodges, Henry Piers, Samuel Taylor, and
John Meriton; also of four lay preachers—Thomas Richards,
Thomas Maxfield, John Bennet, and John Downes.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hodges was the rector of Wenvo, in Wales, a good
man, who, from the first, was friendly to the Methodists, and
who showed his love for Wesley, in 1758, by writing him a
reproof for the tartness of some of his controversial writings,
and which Wesley had the honest manliness to publish in his
<i>Arminian Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Piers has been already noticed. Samuel Taylor
was the great great grandson of the celebrated Dr.
Rowland Taylor, of Hadleigh, in Suffolk, who was forcibly
ejected from his church; whom Gardiner, from the woolsack,
addressed as “a knave, a traitor, and a villain”;
whom Bonner was about to strike with his crosier, and was
only hindered by Taylor telling him he would strike again;
and who, amid the tears and prayers of his afflicted flock, was
put into a pitch barrel, by the bloodthirsty papists, on the
9th of February, 1555, and was set on fire, one zealous vagabond
flinging a fagot at his head, and another impatient
ruffian cleaving his skull with a halbert, while he was singing
in the flames, “In God have I put my trust, I will not fear
what man can do unto me.” The descendant of this brave-hearted
martyr partook of his ancestor’s zealous and heroic
spirit. He was vicar of Quinton in Gloucestershire; but his
heart was larger than his parish. Like Wesley, he went out
into the highways and hedges, and was a sharer in the brutal
persecutions of Wednesbury, Darlaston, and other places.
Richard Whatcoat, one of the first Methodist bishops in
America, when a child, sat under his ministry, and received
impressions which he never lost.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> As a preacher, Mr. Taylor
was zealous, pathetic, and powerful. He died about the year
1750.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Meriton had been educated in one of the universities,
and was now a clergyman from the Isle of Man.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> The last
years of his life seem to have been chiefly spent in accompanying
the two Wesleys in their preaching excursions, and
in assisting them in the chapels they had built. He died
in 1753.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span></p>

<p>Of the four lay members of the first Methodist conference,
three afterwards left Wesley, and became ministers of other
churches. John Downes was the only one who lived and
died a Methodist.</p>

<p>The day before the conference commenced was one to be
remembered. Besides the ordinary preaching services, a
lovefeast was held, at which six ordained ministers were
present; and, during the day, the sacrament was administered
to the whole of the London society, now numbering between
two and three thousand members. At this grand sacramental
service five clergymen assisted.</p>

<p>On the day following, the conference was opened, with
solemn prayer, a sermon by Charles Wesley, and the
baptism of an adult, who there and then found peace with
God.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> The three points debated were:—1. What to teach.
2. How to teach. 3. How to regulate doctrine, discipline,
and practice.</p>

<p>In reference to the first point, it was settled that, to be
justified is to be pardoned, and received into God’s favour;
that faith, preceded by repentance, is the condition of justification;
that repentance is a conviction of sin; that faith, in
general, is a Divine, supernatural <i>elenchos</i> of things not seen;
and that justifying faith is a conviction, by the Holy Ghost,
that Christ loved me, and gave Himself for me; that no man
can be justified and not know it; that the immediate fruits
of justifying faith are peace, joy, love, power over all outward
sin, and power to keep down inward sin; that wilful sin is
inconsistent with justifying faith; that no believer need ever
again come into condemnation; that works are necessary for
the continuance of faith, which cannot be lost but for want of
them; and that St. Paul and St. James do not contradict
each other, when one says Abraham was not justified by
works, and the other that he was, because they do not speak
of the same justification, and because they do not speak of
the same works,—St. Paul speaking of works that precede
faith, and St. James of works that spring from it.</p>

<p>The Conference further agreed, that Adam’s sin is imputed
to all mankind in the sense, that in consequence of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
sin—(1) our bodies are mortal; (2) our souls disunited from
God, and of a sinful, devilish nature; and (3) we are liable to
death eternal. It was further agreed, that the Bible never
expressly affirms, that God imputes the righteousness of
Christ to any, but rather, that faith is imputed to us for
righteousness. At the same time, the Conference conceived
that, by the merits of Christ, all men are cleared from the
guilt of Adam’s actual sin; that their bodies will become
immortal after the resurrection; that their souls receive a
capacity of spiritual life, and an actual spark or seed thereof;
and that all believers are reconciled to God and made partakers
of the Divine nature.</p>

<p>Sanctification was defined, a renewal in the image of God,
in righteousness and true holiness; to be a <i>perfect Christian</i> is
to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and
strength, implying the destruction of all inward sin; and faith
is the condition and instrument by which such a state of
grace is obtained.</p>

<p>Proceeding to other matters, the Conference resolved to
defend the doctrine of the Church of England both by their
preaching and living; to obey the bishops in all things
indifferent, and to observe the canons as far as they could
with a safe conscience; and, finally, to exert themselves to
the utmost not to entail a schism in the Church, by their
hearers forming themselves into a distinct sect; though they
agreed that they must not neglect the present opportunity of
saving souls, for fear of consequences which might possibly or
probably happen, after they were dead.</p>

<p>The belief was expressed, that the design of God in raising
up the preachers, called Methodists, was to reform the nation,
more particularly the Church; and to spread scriptural
holiness through the land. It was decided that, wherever
they preached, they ought to endeavour to form societies,
because where societies were not formed, the preacher would
not be able to give proper instructions to them that were
convinced of sin; nor the people to watch over one another
in love, bear one another’s burdens, and build up each other
in faith and holiness. It was stated, that the Methodists were
divided into four sections; namely, the united societies, the
bands, the select societies, and the penitents. The united<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
societies, who were the most numerous, consisted of awakened
persons. The bands were selected from these, and consisted
of those who were supposed to have remission of sins. The
select societies were taken from the bands, and were composed
of those who seemed to walk in the light of God’s
countenance. The penitents were those who, for the present,
were fallen from grace. After this, the rules of the united
societies, and of the bands, were read. The rules of the
select societies were the same as those of the bands, with
three additions:—1. That nothing spoken in their meetings
be spoken again. 2. That every member submit to his
minister in all indifferent things. 3. That, till they could
have all things common, every member should bring, once a
week, all he could spare toward a common stock. The
penitents were left without rules.</p>

<p>It was agreed, that lay assistants were allowable only in
cases of necessity. They were to expound every morning
and evening; to meet the united societies, the bands, the
select societies, and the penitents, once a week; to visit
the classes once a quarter; to hear and decide all differences;
to put the disorderly back on trial, and to receive
on trial for the bands or society; to see that the stewards,
the leaders, schoolmasters, and housekeepers faithfully discharged
their several offices; and to meet the leaders and
the stewards weekly, and to examine their accounts. They
were to be serious; to converse sparingly and cautiously
with women; to take no step towards marriage without
first acquainting Wesley or his brother clergymen; and
to do nothing as a <i>gentleman</i>, for they had no more to do
with this character than with that of a dancing master.
They were to be ashamed of nothing but sin; not of fetching
wood, or drawing water; not of cleaning their own shoes, or
their neighbour’s. They were to take no money of any one,
and were to contract no debts without Wesley’s knowledge;
they were not to mend the rules, but keep them; to employ
their time as Wesley directed, and to keep journals, as well
for Wesley’s satisfaction as for profit to themselves.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>It was decided, that they should preach most, where those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
of them who were clergymen could preach in a church; where
they could get the greatest number of quiet and willing
hearers; and where they had most success. It was agreed,
that field preaching had been used too sparingly; that every
alternate meeting of the society, in every place, should be
strictly private; and that at the other meeting strangers might
be admitted with caution, but not the same person above twice
or thrice. To improve the usefulness of classleaders, it was
resolved that each leader should be diligently examined, concerning
his method of meeting a class; that all of them should
converse with the preachers, as frequently and as freely as
possible; that they should attend the leaders’ meeting every
week, bringing notes of all sick persons in their classes; and
that none should speak in the leaders’ meeting but the preacher
or the steward, unless in answer to a question. The members
were to be more closely examined, at the general visitation of
the classes; the married men and married women, and the
single men and single women were to be met apart once a
quarter; and all the members were to be visited at their own
houses, at times fixed for such a purpose. Tickets were to be
given to none, till they were recommended by a leader with
whom they had met three months on trial; and new members
were to be admitted into the society only on the Sunday following
the quarterly visitation, their names being read on the
Sunday night previous. It was agreed, also that it was lawful
for Methodists to bear arms; and that they might use the
law as defendants, and perhaps in some cases as plaintiffs.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>Other regulations were adopted, either at this or ensuing
conferences, as follows: preachers were to meet the children
in every place, and give them suitable exhortations; they
were to preach expressly and strongly against sabbath breaking,
dram drinking, evil speaking, unprofitable conversation,
lightness, gaiety, or expensiveness of apparel, and contracting
debts without sufficient care to discharge them; they were to
recommend to every society, frequently and earnestly, the
books that Wesley published, as preferable to any other; they
were to use their best endeavours to extirpate smuggling, and
also bribery at elections; they were to speak to any that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
desired it, every day after the morning and evening preaching.
As often as possible, they were to rise at four o’clock; to spend
two or three minutes every hour in earnest prayer; to observe
strictly the morning and evening hour of retirement; to
rarely employ above an hour at a time in conversation; to use
all the means of grace; to keep watchnights once a month;
to take a regular catalogue of the societies once a year; to
speak freely to each other, and never to part without prayer.
They were never to preach more than twice a day, unless on
Sundays or extraordinary occasions; to begin and end the
service precisely at the time appointed; to always suit their
subject to their congregations; to choose the plainest texts
possible, and to beware of allegorizing and rambling from
their texts. They were to avoid everything awkward or
affected, either in phrase, gesture, or pronunciation; to
sing no hymns of their own composing; to choose hymns
proper for the congregation; not to sing more than five or
six verses at a time, and to suit the tune to the nature of the
hymns. After preaching, they were recommended to take
lemonade, candied orange peel, or a little soft, warm ale;
and to avoid late suppers, and egg and wine, as downright
poison.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>Here we find six clergymen and four lay preachers, not
elaborating an ecclesiastical structure, but carefully considering
the greatest truths of the Christian religion, and investigating
the duties of its preachers. Six days were spent in this
important work. They desired nothing, said Wesley, but to
save their own souls and those that heard them. Their
doctrines, so simple and encouraging, were not the popular
theology of the age; but they were in the Scriptures, and
what every sinner needed. They little thought, that they
were constructing a platform which would survive their times,
and originating a long series of annual conferences which
would become one of the most important institutions in the
world; a central power, conveying religious benefits to every
quarter of the globe, and serving as a model for framing
other similar institutions both at home and abroad. The
doctrines agreed upon are still the staple doctrines of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
Methodist communities, and the elements of Methodist discipline
may be found in the minutes of this the first Methodist
conference.</p>

<p>Leaving Wesley’s first conference, we pass to his last sermon
before the university of Oxford.</p>

<p>The day appointed for the sermon was Friday, August 24,
the anniversary of St. Bartholomew, and occurred in Oxford
race week. The duty came to Wesley by rotation; and
had he declined it, he must have paid three guineas for a
substitute. We have three accounts of this celebrated sermon.
From Charles Wesley we learn, that he and Mr. Piers and
Mr. Meriton were present at its delivery; that the audience
was a large one, and much increased by the racers; that
the congregation gave the utmost attention; that some of the
heads of colleges stood during the whole service, and fixed
their eyes upon the preacher; and that, after the sermon,
the little band of four Methodist clergymen walked away in
form, none daring to join them.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s own account is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I preached, I suppose the last time, at St. Mary’s. Be it so. I am
now clear of the blood of these men. I have fully delivered my own soul.
The beadle came to me afterwards, and told me the vice-chancellor had
sent him for my notes. I sent them without delay, not without admiring the
wise providence of God. Perhaps few men of note would have given a
sermon of mine the reading, if I had put it into their hands; but, by this
means, it came to be read, probably more than once, by every man of
eminence in the university.”<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>“I am well pleased that the sermon was preached on the very day on
which, in the last century, near two thousand burning and shining lights
were put out at one stroke. Yet what a wide difference is there between
their case and mine! They were turned out of house and home, and all
that they had; whereas I am only hindered from preaching, without any
other loss; and that in a kind of honourable manner; it being determined
that, when my next turn to preach came, they would pay another person
to preach for me; and so they did, twice or thrice, even to the time that
I resigned my fellowship.”<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The third account is by the celebrated Dr. Kennicott, who
was, at this period, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, and an
undergraduate of Wadham College. He had no sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
with the Methodists, and yet he appears to have been deeply
impressed with Wesley’s sermon. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All that are masters of arts, and on the foundation of any college, are
set down in a roll, as they take their degree; and, in that order, preach
before the university, or pay three guineas for a preacher in their stead;
and as no clergyman can avoid his turn, so the university can refuse none;
otherwise Mr. Wesley would not have preached. He came to Oxford
some time before, and preached frequently every day in courts, public
houses, and elsewhere. On Friday morning, having held forth twice in
private, at five and at eight, he came to St. Mary’s at ten o’clock. There
were present the vice-chancellor, the proctors, most of the heads of
houses, a vast number of gownsmen, and a multitude of private people,
with many of Wesley’s own people, both brethren and sisters. He is
neither tall nor fat; for the latter would ill become a Methodist. His
black hair, quite smooth, and parted very exactly, added to a peculiar
composure in his countenance, showed him to be an uncommon man. His
prayer was soft, short, and conformable to the rules of the university.
His text was Acts iv. 31. He spoke it very slowly, and with an agreeable
emphasis.” [Here follows a description of the sermon.] “When he
came to what he called his plain, practical conclusion, he fired his address
with so much zeal and unbounded satire as quite spoiled what otherwise
might have been turned to great advantage; for, as I liked some, so I
disliked other parts of his discourse extremely. I liked some of his freedom,
such as calling the generality of young gownsmen ‘a generation of
triflers,’ and many other just invectives. But, considering how many
shining lights are here, that are the glory of the Christian cause, his
sacred censure was much too flaming and strong, and his charity much
too weak in not making large allowances. But, so far from allowances,
he concluded, with a lifted up eye, in this most solemn form, ‘It is time
for Thee, Lord, to lay to Thine hand;’ words full of such presumption and
seeming imprecation, that they gave an universal shock. This, and the
assertion that Oxford was not a Christian city, and this country not a
Christian nation, were the most offensive parts of the sermon, except
when he accused the whole body (and confessed himself to be one of the
number) of the sin of perjury; and for this reason, because, upon becoming
members of a college, every person takes an oath to observe the
statutes of the university, and no one observes them in all things. Had
these things been omitted, and his censures moderated, I think his discourse,
as to style, and delivery, would have been uncommonly pleasing
to others as well as to myself. He is allowed to be a man of great parts,
and that by the excellent Dean of Christ Church (Dr. Conybeare); for the
day he preached, the dean generously said of him, ‘John Wesley will
always be thought a man of sound sense, though an enthusiast.’ However,
the vice-chancellor sent for the sermon, and I hear the heads of
colleges intend to show their resentment.”<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span></p>

<p>This obnoxious sermon was published a few weeks after it
was preached, and was advertised in the October magazines,
price sixpence.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Another edition was issued in the same
year, at Newcastle on Tyne, 12mo, eighteen pages.</p>

<p>In a preface to the reader, Wesley says, that he never intended
to print the latter part of the sermon; but “the false
and scurrilous accounts of it which had been published, almost
in every corner of the nation, now constrained him to publish
the whole, just as it was preached, that men of reason might
judge for themselves.”</p>

<p>The sermon has three divisions, and considers Christianity
under three distinct aspects—(1) As beginning to exist in
individuals. (2) As spreading from one to another. (3) As
covering the earth. Of these nothing need be said. That
which gave offence was the “plain, practical application,”
which is quite one third of the entire discourse. The following
extracts will show what it was that gave the offence which
Oxford authorities never pardoned; and also the fidelity and
Christian courage of the preacher in uttering such sentiments
before such a congregation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, if ye do account <i>me</i>
a madman or a fool, yet <i>as a fool bear with me</i>. It is utterly needful, that
some one should use great plainness of speech towards you. It is more
especially needful at <i>this</i> time; for who knoweth but it is the <i>last</i>? And
who will use this plainness, if I do not? Therefore I, even I, will speak.
And I adjure you, by the living God, that ye steel not your hearts against
receiving a blessing at <i>my</i> hands.</p>

<p>“Let me ask you then, in tender love, and in the spirit of meekness, Is
this city a <i>Christian</i> city? Is <i>Christianity, scriptural Christianity</i>, found
here? Are we, considered as a community of men, so filled with the Holy
Ghost as to enjoy in our hearts, and show forth in our lives, the genuine
fruits of that Spirit? Are all the magistrates, all heads and governors of
colleges and halls, and their respective societies, (not to speak of the
inhabitants of the town,) of one heart and soul? Is the love of God shed
abroad in our hearts? Are our tempers the same that were in Christ?
And are our lives agreeable thereto?</p>

<p>“In the fear, and in the presence of the great God, before whom both
you and I shall shortly appear, I pray you that are in authority over us,
whom I reverence for your office sake, to consider, Are you filled with
the Holy Ghost? Are ye lively portraitures of Him whom ye are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
appointed to represent among men? Ye magistrates and rulers, are all
the thoughts of your hearts, all your tempers and desires, suitable to your
high calling? Are all your words like unto those which come out of the
mouth of God? Is there in all your actions dignity and love?</p>

<p>“Ye venerable men, who are more especially called to form the tender
minds of youth, are you filled with the Holy Ghost? with all those fruits
of the Spirit, which your important office so indispensably requires? Do
you continually remind those under your care, that the one rational end
of all our studies is to know, love, and serve the only true God, and
Jesus Christ whom He hath sent? Do you inculcate upon them, day by
day, that without love all learning is but splendid ignorance, pompous
folly, vexation of spirit? Has all you teach an actual tendency to the
love of God, and of all mankind for His sake? Do you put forth all your
strength in the vast work you have undertaken—using every talent which
God hath lent you, and that to the uttermost of your power?</p>

<p>“What example is set them” [the youth] “by us who enjoy the
beneficence of our forefathers,—by fellows, students, scholars,—more
especially those who are of some rank and eminence? Do ye, brethren,
abound in the fruits of the Spirit,—in lowliness of mind, in self denial
and mortification, in seriousness and composure of spirit, in patience,
meekness, sobriety, temperance, and in unwearied, restless endeavours to
do good, in every kind, unto all men? Is this the general character of
fellows of colleges? I fear it is not. Rather, have not pride and
haughtiness of spirit, impatience and peevishness, sloth and indolence,
gluttony and sensuality, and even a proverbial uselessness, been objected
to us, <i>perhaps</i> not always by our enemies, nor <i>wholly</i> without ground?</p>

<p>“Many of us are more immediately consecrated to God, called to
minister in holy things. Are we then patterns to the rest, in word, in conversation,
in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity? From what motives
did we enter upon this office? Was it with a single eye to serve God?
Have we clearly determined to give ourselves wholly to it? Do we
forsake and set aside, as much as in us lies, all worldly cares and studies?
Are we apt to teach? Are we taught of God, that we may be able to
teach others also? What are the seals of our apostleship? Who, that
were dead in trespasses and sins, have been quickened by our word?
Have we a burning zeal to save souls from death; so that, for their sake,
we often forget even to eat our bread?</p>

<p>“Once more, What shall we say concerning the youth of this place?
Have <i>you</i> either the form or the power of <i>Christian</i> godliness? Are you
humble, teachable, advisable? or stubborn, self willed, heady, and high-minded?
Are you obedient to your superiors as to parents? Or do you
despise those to whom you owe the tenderest reverence? Are you
diligent in pursuing your studies with all your strength, crowding as
much work into every day as it can contain? Rather, do you not waste
day after day, either in reading what has no tendency to Christianity, or
in gaming, or in—you know not what? Do you, out of principle, take
care to owe no man anything? Do you remember the sabbath day to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
keep it holy? Do you know how to possess your bodies in sanctification
and in honour? Are not drunkenness and uncleanness found among
you? Yea, are there not of you, who glory in their shame? Do not
many of you take the name of God in vain, perhaps habitually, without
either remorse or fear? Yea, are there not a multitude of you that are
forsworn? Be not surprised, brethren; before God and this congregation,
I own myself to have been of that number; solemnly swearing to <i>observe
all those customs</i>, which I then knew nothing of; and <i>those statutes</i>,
which I did not so much as read over, either then or for some years after.
What is perjury, if this is not?</p>

<p>“May it not be one of the consequences of this, that so many of you
are a generation of triflers? triflers with God, with one another, and with
your own souls? How few of you spend, from one week to another, a
single hour in private prayer? How few have any thought of God in the
general tenour of your conversation? Can you bear, unless now and then,
in a church, any talk of the Holy Ghost? Would you not take it for
granted, if one began such a conversation, that it was either hypocrisy or
enthusiasm? In the name of the Lord God almighty, I ask, What
religion are you of? Even the talk of <i>Christianity</i> ye cannot, will not
bear. O my brethren! What a Christian city is this? It is time for
Thee, Lord, to lay to Thine hand.</p>

<p>“For indeed, what probability, what possibility is there, that Christianity,
scriptural Christianity, should be again the religion of this place?
that all orders of men among us should speak and live as men filled with
the Holy Ghost? By whom should this Christianity be restored? By
those of you that are in authority? Are you desirous it should be
restored? And do ye not count your fortune, liberty, life, dear unto yourselves,
so ye may be instrumental in restoring it? But suppose ye have
this desire, who hath any power proportioned to the effect? Perhaps
some of you have made a few faint attempts, but with how small success?
Shall Christianity then be restored by young, unknown, inconsiderable
men? I know not whether ye yourselves would suffer it. Would not
some of you cry out, ‘Young man, in so doing thou reproachest us’?
But there is no danger of your being put to the proof; so hath iniquity
overspread us like a flood. Whom then shall God send? The famine,
the pestilence, or the sword, the last messengers of God to a guilty land?
The armies of the Romish aliens, to reform us into our first love? Nay,
rather, let us fall into Thy hand, O Lord, and let us not fall into the hand
of man!”</p>
</div>

<p>This is not only the substance, but nearly the whole of the
“plain, practical application,” that created so much offence.
Who can find fault with it? Rather, who will not commend
the bold preacher, who, in such yearning accents, gave utterance
to truths of the highest consequence, but which perhaps
no one but himself, in such a congregation, durst have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
uttered? Would to God that pulpits had more of this
courageous, pitying fidelity, at the present day! Is it not a
fact, that preaching now-a-days consists so much of polite and
pious platitudes, that, so far from saving souls, it is almost
powerless? The age is too refined to tolerate preachers of
the stamp of Luther, Knox, and Wesley. The words of the
prophets are, in this pretentiously polite period of the church’s
history, well worth pondering: “They have healed the hurt
of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace;
when there is no peace.” “This is a rebellious people, lying
children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord;
which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
not unto us right things; speak unto us smooth things;
prophesy deceits.”</p>

<p>It was Wesley’s fidelity, far more than the novelty of his
doctrines and proceedings, that brought upon him the persecutions
he encountered. Of these, he and the Methodists had
already had their share; but the vials of the people’s wrath
were far from being emptied. The outrages in Staffordshire
and other places have been already mentioned. “In Cornwall,”
says Wesley, “the war against the Methodists was
carried on with far more vigour than that against the
Spaniards.” “At St. Ives,” writes Henry Millard, “the word
of God runs and is glorified; but the devil rages horribly.”
At Camborne, Thomas Westall was pulled down while
preaching in Mr. Harris’s house; was carried to Penzance,
where Dr. Borlase wrote a “mittimus” committing him to the
house of correction at Bodmin as a vagrant; and here he
was kept till the next quarter sessions, when the justices,
then assembled, knowing a little more of the laws of God and
man than Dr. Borlase and his Penzance <i>confrères</i>, declared
his commitment to be illegal, and set him at liberty. “For
what pay,” asks Wesley, justly proud of his preachers,
“could we procure men to do this service,—to be always
ready to go to prison or to death?” Dr. Borlase was a man
of unquestioned sense and learning; but he was a bigot of
the purest water. On his asking Jonathan Reeves to point
him out a man who had been the better for hearing the
Methodists, Jonathan pointed to John Daniel, then before
him. “Get along,” cried the doctor. “Get along; you are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
parcel of mad, crazy headed fellows;” and taking them by
the shoulders, he thrust them to the doors. After this, we
find him issuing warrants for the apprehension of Methodists;
sending Thomas Maxfield to be a soldier; and signing a
warrant for the arrest of Wesley himself; yet all this was not
sufficient to prevent Wesley rendering to the Cornish bigot
his due share of literary praise. “I looked over,” writes
Wesley, in 1757, “Dr. Borlase’s Antiquities of Cornwall. He
is a fine writer, and quite master of his subject. He has
distinguished, with amazing accuracy, the ancient Saxon
monuments from the more ancient Roman, and from those of
the Druids, the most ancient of all.”<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> The doctor died in
1772.</p>

<p>Dr. Borlase was not alone; for his brother clergymen raged
against the Methodists without measure, and, in their sermons,
retailed the grossest lies concerning them. A poor woman
complained to the mayor of St. Ives of some one throwing a
huge stone into her house, which fell on a pillow within a
few inches of her suckling child. His worship damned her,
and said she might go about her business. One of the clergy
told Jonathan Reeves, he wished the Bible were in Latin
only, so that none of the common people could read it.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> The
mob at St. Ives saluted Wesley with stones and dirt; and
pulled down the meeting-house, “for joy that Admiral
Matthews had beat the Spaniards.” It was a gratifying fact,
however, that, notwithstanding the fierceness of the Cornish
persecution, not more than three or four of the Methodists
turned cowardly deserters, while the rest, instead of being
shaken, were confirmed in their principles by the violence of
their enemies.</p>

<p>The press was still vigorously employed. An anonymous
pamphlet, entitled “Observations upon the Conduct and Behaviour
of a certain Sect usually designated by the name of
Methodists,” 4to, pages 24, was written by Dr. Gibson, and
obtained considerable approval from his brother bishops.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> In
this prelatical publication, the Methodists are charged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
setting government at defiance, by appointing public places of
religious worship, and by preaching in the open air, without
taking the prescribed oaths, and subscribing the declaration
against Popery. They broke the rules of the church of which
they professed themselves members, by going to other than
their own parish churches to receive the sacrament. Their doctrines
and practices were a dis-service to religion—1. Because
they set the standard of religion so high, that some were led
to disregard religion altogether. 2. Because they carried the
doctrine of justification by faith alone to such a height, as not
to allow that the observance of moral duties is a condition of
being justified. 3. Because a due attendance on the public
offices of religion answered the purposes of devotion better
than the “sudden agonies, roarings, screamings, tremblings,
ravings, and madness of the Methodists.” 4. Because their
exalted strains of religion led to spiritual pride, and to contempt
of their superiors. In short, the irregular practices
of the Methodists were of the like nature as those which
had so great a share in bringing in the religious confusions
of the last century.</p>

<p>Whitefield replied to this pamphlet in two small quarto
tracts, of fourteen and twenty-four pages respectively. This
evoked “A Serious and Expostulatory Letter,” by the Rev.
Thomas Church, M.A., vicar of Battersea, and prebendary of
St. Paul’s;<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> and also another letter, of fifty pages, “by a
Gentleman of Pembroke College, Oxford.” In the latter
production, the Methodists are censured for “suffering their
heated imaginations to mount to such an exalted pitch, that
it hurries them out of their senses, evaporates the religious
spirit, and leaves nothing but sensuality in the heated machine.”
Whitefield’s answer to “Observations on the Conduct
and Behaviour of the Methodists” is politely said to be
“stuffed with the coaxing and wheedling of the <i>woman</i>, the
daring of the <i>rebel</i>, the pertness of the <i>coxcomb</i>, the evasions
of the <i>jesuit</i>, and the bitterness of the <i>bigot</i>.” It is unblushingly
affirmed, that the Methodists “can curse, rail, and
<i>berogue</i> their antagonists, though in Scripture language, so as
hardly to be exceeded by any pope, or <i>spiritual bully</i>, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
ever yet appeared in Christendom.” They are a “rag-tag
mob,” using “lascivious and blasphemously languishing expressions
when they talk of the Redeemer’s love.” “They
cant and blaspheme the Holy Spirit, and appeal to starts and
sallies of flesh and blood for the inspiration of the Holy One.”
They are “a set of creatures of the lowest rank, most of them
illiterate, and of desperate fortunes; cursing, reviling, and
showing their teeth at every one that does not approve of
their frenzy and extravagance.” Whitefield was “crafty and
malicious enough to be suspected of any wicked enterprise,—a
person of wicked principles, travelling over all counties, to
establish newfangled societies”; and he and his friends were
“heads and spiritual directors of hot-brained cobblers, all big
with venom against the clergy of the Established Church.”
The author “trembles and shudders,” lest the Methodists
should be “betrayed, by their feelings and stretchings, into a
bed of eternal fire and brimstone, appointed for the reception
of the lewd, the concupiscent, and the blasphemous.”</p>

<p>These are fair specimens of the foul foamings of this valiant
defender of Church and state.</p>

<p>Another pamphlet, published in 1744, was “A Charge
against Enthusiasm,” delivered, in several parts of his diocese,
by the Bishop of Lichfield; and the object of which was to
prove that “the indwelling and inward witnessing of the
Spirit in believers’ hearts, as also praying and preaching
by the Spirit, are all the <i>extraordinary gifts</i> and operations
of the Holy Ghost, belonging only to the apostolical
and primitive times, and that, consequently, all pretensions
to such favours in these last days are vain and enthusiastical.”</p>

<p>Another, published at a shilling, was “Remarks on Mr. J.
Wesley’s last Journal, by Thomas Church, A.M.,”<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> the prebendary
of St. Paul’s already mentioned. Mr. Church sums
up his charges against Wesley thus: “It is impossible for
you to put an entire stop to the enormities of the Moravians,
while you still (1) too much commend these men; (2) hold
principles in common with them, from which these enormities
naturally follow; and, (3) maintain other errors more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
theirs, and are guilty of enthusiasm to the highest degree.”
Mr. Church’s “Remarks,” however, will have to be noticed in
the next chapter.</p>

<p>In addition to all this foam and fury against the Methodists,
must be mentioned an equally vile attack of another kind.
At the Brecon assizes, held in the month of August, the
grand jury deemed it their duty to make a presentment
to the presiding judge to the following effect: “that the
Methodists held illegal meetings,” and that their “preachers
pretended to expound the Scriptures by virtue of inspiration”;
that, by this means, “they collected together great numbers
of disorderly persons, very much endangering the peace of
our sovereign lord the king; and that, unless their proceedings
were timely suppressed, they might endanger the peace
of the kingdom in general.” At all events, “the pretended
preachers, or teachers, at their irregular meetings, by their
enthusiastic doctrines, very much confounded and disordered
the minds of his majesty’s good subjects”; and this, “in time,
might lead to the overthrowing of our good government, both
in Church and state.” Finally, the judge is requested, if the
authority of the present court was not sufficient for the
purpose, to apply to some superior authority, in order to
put an end to the “villainous scheme” of “such dangerous
assemblies.”<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>Thus had Methodism to make its way through the opposition
of vulgar mobs, fiery priests, lampooning pamphleteers,
unjust magistrates, and grand juries. Gamaliel’s advice was
set aside: “Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for
if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:
but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be
found even to fight against God.”</p>

<p>Wesley’s longest journey, in 1744, was from London to
Cornwall, thence to Newcastle, and thence to London. Nearly
three months were spent upon this evangelistic tour: many
hundreds of miles were traversed, not by rail, or even in
stage coaches, but on horseback, over the most miserable
roads, the rider sometimes battered with rain and hail for
hours together, and at others plunging through drifts of snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
enough to engulf both man and beast. About a hundred
sermons were preached: some, at Gwennap and at St. Stithian,
to thousands upon thousands of attentive hearers; some in
public houses; some on village greens; and a few in parish
churches.</p>

<p>One of the churches Wesley was permitted to occupy was
at Laneast, in Cornwall, of which Mr. Bennett was the aged
clergyman. Another was at Landau, in Wales. “Such a
church,” says Wesley, “I never saw before. There was not
a glass window belonging to it; but only boards, with holes
bored here and there, through which a dim light glimmered.
Yet even here the light of God’s countenance has shone on
many hearts.” In the former of these churches a strange
scene was witnessed in the month of August. Charles
Wesley was preaching “against harmless diversions,” having
three clergymen, Messrs. Meriton, Thompson, and Bennett,
among his auditors. “By harmless diversions,” exclaimed
the preacher, “I was kept asleep in the devils arms, secure
in a state of damnation, for eighteen years.” No sooner were
the words uttered than Meriton added aloud, “And I for
twenty-five!” “And I,” cried Thompson, “for thirty-five!”
“And I,” said Bennett, the venerable minister of the church,
“and I for above seventy.”</p>

<p>Strange and stirring incidents came across Wesley’s path.
In his father’s church, at Epworth, he heard Mr. Romley
preach two of the bitterest and falsest sermons he ever
listened to. On proceeding to Syke House, some of his
friends met him and said a drunken mob was awaiting his
arrival, who would press all the men in the congregation for
soldiers. Others declared, the mob was just about to fire the
meeting-house, or pull it to the ground. Wesley calmly
answered, “Our only way is to make the best use of it
while standing;” and, accordingly, he entered it at once,
and expounded the tenth chapter of Matthew. At Durham,
he met John Nelson and Thomas Beard, at that time
with their regiment, and took them to his inn, and said,
“Brother Nelson, lose no time; speak and spare not, for
God has work for you to do in every place where your
lot is cast; and when you have fulfilled His good pleasure,
He will burst your bonds asunder, and we shall rejoice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
together.”<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> At Chinley, in Derbyshire, lived a poor widow,
of the name of Godhard, with a family of four small children.
At her request, Wesley made Chinley a resting place, and
preached. Finding the widow’s house too small, he stood
upon a chair near to a miller’s dam. The miller, enraged
at Wesley and his congregation daring to worship in such
proximity to his premises, let off the water for the purpose
of drowning Wesley’s voice. The effort was a failure;
truth triumphed; Chinley became a Methodist preaching
place; and, in order to provide the preachers when they
called with a cup of tea, the poor widow and her children
set apart the whole of every Friday night for winding
bobbins, depositing the earnings, as a sacred treasure, in an
old pint mug, and never touching them except to meet the
necessities of Wesley’s itinerants when paying their gospel
visits.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>Already Wesley’s lay preachers had become a considerable
host. In different parts of the kingdom there were, at least,
forty of these devoted evangelists.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Some of them, as John
Brown, of Newcastle, David Taylor, John Downes, John
Nelson, William Shepherd, John Slocomb, Thomas Westall,
Thomas Beard, John Haime, Thomas Richards, John Bennet,
and Thomas Maxfield, have been already mentioned. Besides
these, there were—John Haughton, originally a weaver, who,
whilst the mob, in the city of Cork, were burning Wesley
in effigy, threw up the window and began to preach to the
people in the street; and who, afterwards, obtained episcopal
ordination and settled in the sister country;—Jonathan
Reeves, who was with Wesley when he laid the first stone
of the Orphan House at Newcastle, and who, after passing
through a great amount of persecution, became an ordained
minister of the Church of England, preached in London, and
died in 1778, testifying that all his hope was in Christ Jesus;—Enoch
Williams, pious, deeply devoted to his work, faithful
and successful, and brought to an untimely grave in 1744;—Thomas
Williams, extremely popular as a preacher; but
haughty, revengeful, headstrong, and unmanageable; a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
favourite among the London young ladies; but a maligner of
the two Wesleys; expelled in 1744, but taken back on
declaring, before many witnesses, that the slanders he had
propagated against Wesley and his brother were grossly false;
the man who introduced Methodism into Ireland in 1747, but
who was again expelled from the Methodist society in 1755;
and then, through the Countess of Huntingdon, obtained episcopal
ordination, and for several years acted as a clergyman
in the neighbourhood of High Wycombe;—Thomas Meyrick,
a native of Cornwall, educated for the law, a poet, but expelled
from the Methodist connexion in 1750, after which he
became a clergyman of the Established Church, and died, we
fear, a drunkard, at Halifax, in 1770;—John Trembath, one
of Wesley’s most courageous preachers, though somewhat
vain and stubborn; then a farmer and a fibber; and, for a
long series of years, an impoverished vagabond, who died
about 1794;—Alexander Coates, a poor Scotch “laddie,” fond
of books, who could speak in Gaelic, read with fluency in
Dutch and Danish, and had some acquaintance with Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin; the honoured instrument in the conversion
of Mr. Crosse, the well known Bradford vicar; one of the
best of men, and a most useful preacher, who died, at Newcastle,
in 1765, in perfect peace;—William Darney, another
Scotchman, honest, bold, impetuous, a rhymer, and painfully
eccentric, but who was used by Providence in converting
Grimshaw, and who prided himself upon never “<i>dabbing</i>
people with untempered mortar”;—Nicholas Gilbert, a man of
deep piety, and of great simplicity, possessed of considerable
talents, and pronounced by Wesley “an excellent preacher”;—Samuel
Larwood, who in 1754 became a Dissenting minister
in the borough of Southwark;—James Jones, one of the first
fruits of Wesley’s ministry in Staffordshire, as bold as a lion,
and who built, at his own expense, the first Methodist chapel
at Tipton Green;—Joseph Jones, who left the itinerancy in
1760, became a farmer in the county of Somerset, and acted
as a local preacher to the end of life;—Herbert Jenkins, who
afterwards became one of Whitefield’s preachers, and laboured
in the Tabernacle connexion;—John Maddern, a man of
genuine piety, and a lively, zealous preacher;—Henry Millard,
who, after narrowly escaping a violent death at the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
of a Cornish mob, fell a victim to an attack of small pox,
in 1746;—William Prior, of whom Charles Wesley, in a
manuscript letter now before us, dated 1755, writes: “William
Prior is ordained, without learning, interest, or aught but
Providence to recommend him”;—Robert Swindells, a man of
great benevolence, who was never heard to speak an unkind
word of any one, had no enemy, and died full of days, riches,
and honour in 1783;—James Wheatley, of Norwich notoriety,
where he was often dragged by the hair of his head through the
streets of the city, built a large chapel, and became immensely
popular, but who ultimately died, beneath a cloud, in Bristol;—Francis
Walker, a native of Tewkesbury, pious, honest, and
upright, his talents small, but his preaching lively, zealous,
and useful, an instrument of great good to souls wherever
he went, and who settled in the city of Gloucester, where he
died in peace. And to all these must be added William
Biggs, Thomas Crouch, John Hall, Thomas Hardwick,
Francis Scott, David Tratham, Thomas Willes, and William
Holmes.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be related concerning the year
1744. The Newcastle society was increasingly earnest,
there hardly being a trifler left. The society at Bristol was
not so perfect as it should have been, many of the members
crying out, “Faith, faith! Believe, believe!” but making
little account of the fruits of faith, either of holiness or good
works. The London society was poor, but generous. At
a single collection, in the month of February, they contributed
nearly fifty pounds to relieve the destitute around
them, and which Wesley at once laid out in buying clothes
for those whom he knew to be diligent and yet in want. A
month later, they made a second collection of about thirty
pounds. A month later still, a third collection of about six-and-twenty
pounds; and to these three collections were
added ninety pounds more in the shape of private subscriptions;
making altogether £196 raised by the poor
London Methodists, and employed in providing clothing for
three hundred and sixty persons.</p>

<p>Already some of Wesley’s people began to profess Christian
perfection; but he was extremely cautious in receiving their
testimony. At the end of the year, he writes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was with two persons who believe they are saved from all sin. Be
it so, or not, why should we not rejoice in the work of God, so far as it is
unquestionably wrought in them? For instance, I ask John C——, ‘Do
you always pray? Do you rejoice in God every moment? Do you in
everything give thanks? In loss? In pain? In sickness, weariness,
disappointments? Do you desire nothing? Do you fear nothing? Do
you feel the love of God continually in your heart? Have you a witness
in whatever you speak or do, that it is pleasing to God?’ If he can
solemnly and deliberately answer in the affirmative, why do I not rejoice
and praise God on his behalf? Perhaps, because I have an exceeding
complex idea of sanctification, or a sanctified man. And so, for fear
he should not have attained all I include in that idea, I cannot rejoice in
what he has attained.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is significant language. Wesley preached the doctrine;
but he was slow to believe those who professed to experience
it; and it is a fact more remarkable, that, so far as there
is evidence to show, Wesley never, to the day of his death,
professed as much as this himself. Hundreds, if not thousands,
of his followers did; perhaps he himself was restrained from
doing so, by a dislike to high profession, or by a conscientious
fear, that he hardly reached the standard above set up.</p>

<p>The thing occasioned him great anxiety. A short time
before his death, he wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Four or five and forty years ago, I had no distinct views of what the
apostle meant by exhorting us to ‘leave the principles of the doctrine of
Christ, and go on to perfection;’ but two or three persons in London,
whom I knew to be truly sincere, desired to give me an account of their
experience. It appeared exceeding strange, being different from any that
I had heard before. The next year, two or three more persons at Bristol,
and two or three at Kingswood, coming to me severally, gave me exactly
the same account of their experience. A few years after, I desired all
those in London who made the same profession, to come to me all together
at the Foundery, that I might be thoroughly satisfied. I desired that
man of God, Thomas Walsh, to give us the meeting there. When we
met, first one of us, and then another, asked them the most searching
questions we could devise. They answered every one without hesitation,
and with the utmost simplicity, so that we were fully persuaded, they
did not deceive themselves. In the years 1759 to 1762 their numbers
multiplied exceedingly, not only in London and Bristol, but in various
parts of Ireland as well as England. Not trusting to the testimony
of others, I carefully examined most of these myself; and, in London
alone, I found 652 members of our society who were exceeding clear
in their experience, and of whose testimony I could see no reason to
doubt. I believe no year has passed since that time, wherein God has
not wrought the same work in many others; and every one of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
(without a single exception) has declared, that his deliverance from sin
was <i>instantaneous</i>; that the change was wrought in a moment. Had
half of these, or one third, or one in twenty, declared it was <i>gradually</i>
wrought in <i>them</i>, I should have believed this, with regard to <i>them</i>, and
thought that <i>some</i> were gradually sanctified and some instantaneously.
But as I have not found, in so long a space of time, a single person
speaking thus, I cannot but believe, that sanctification is commonly, if
not always, an <i>instantaneous</i> work.”<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is a subject of vast importance, and will often recur in
future pages. Meanwhile, all will give Wesley credit for the
utmost sincerity, though some may doubt whether human
experience is, in itself, sufficient to settle and decide Christian
doctrine.</p>

<p>Wesley’s pen was, if possible, more busily employed than
ever; not so much in composing original productions, as
in abridging and revising the works of others. During the
year 1744, he published the following:—</p>

<p>1. The sermon preached before the Oxford university on
August 24.</p>

<p>2. An Extract from his Journal, from November 1, 1739, to
September 3, 1741. With prefatory Letter to the Moravian
Church, dated June 24, 1744; and two hymns annexed, on
“The Means of Grace,” and “The Bloody Issue,” both having
reference to the Moravian controversy.</p>

<p>3. The Rules of the Band Societies. These, as we have
already seen, were read at the conference held in June.
During the year, they were published in the form following:—“The
Nature, Design, and General Rules of the
United Societies, in London, Bristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle
upon Tyne. The fourth edition. To which are subjoined
the Rules of the Band Societies. London: printed by William
Strahan. 1744.” 12mo, twelve pages. The <i>Rules</i> of the band
societies were the same as those which Wesley had drawn up
for the Moravian bands, in 1738. The band society members
were composed, as previously stated, of persons who professed
to have obtained the forgiveness of sins. They were middle
class Methodists; that is, in a more advanced state than the
members of the “United Societies,” but not so advanced as
the “Select Societies.” The questions to be proposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
every one before he was admitted were to the following
effect:—1. Have you forgiveness of sins? 2. Peace with
God? 3. The witness of the Spirit? 4. Is the love of God
shed abroad in your heart? 5. Has no sin dominion over
you? 6. Do you desire to be told of your faults? 7. Do
you desire we should tell you whatsoever we think, fear, or
hear concerning you? 8. Is it your desire and design, on
this and all other occasions, to speak everything that is in
your heart, without exception, without disguise, and without
reserve?</p>

<p>The propriety of such questions will be doubted, and
especially of other five which had to be proposed at every
meeting, and which have been given in a previous chapter.
(See page <a href="#Page_210">210</a>.) It would have been no loss to Methodism
or to the religious world, if these queries, first drawn up
by Wesley on Christmas day, 1738, had been allowed to
slumber in the shades of Moravian oblivion. At present,
they are never used; and though, in the first instance, they
might be adapted to the Moravian brotherhood, they are far
too inquisitorial for Methodists.</p>

<p>The bands had to meet once a week; and were bound to
observe the following “Directions”:—</p>

<p>I. To abstain from evil, especially buying or selling on the
sabbath; tasting spirituous liquors; pawning; backbiting;
wearing needless ornaments, as rings, earrings, necklaces, lace,
and ruffles; and taking snuff or tobacco.</p>

<p>II. To maintain good works,—especially almsgiving; reproving
sin; together with diligence, frugality, and self
denial.</p>

<p>III. To use all the ordinances of God; especially service at
church, and sacrament once a week; likewise every public
meeting of the bands; the ministry of the word every morning;
private prayer every day; reading the Scriptures at
every vacant hour; and observing all Fridays in the year
as days of fasting or abstinence.</p>

<p>4. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1744, was “Modern
Christianity exemplified at Wednesbury, and other adjacent
places in Staffordshire.” 12mo, twenty-eight pages. The
substance of this pamphlet has been already given in the
account of the Staffordshire riots; but the prayer at the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
of it is too remarkable to be passed without notice. The
following is an extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Lo, I come, if this soul and body may be useful to anything, to do Thy
will, O God. If it please Thee to use the power Thou hast over dust and
ashes, here they are to suffer Thy good pleasure. If Thou pleasest to
visit me either with pain or dishonour, I will humble myself under it, and,
through Thy grace, be obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
Hereafter no man can take away anything from me, no life, no honour, no
estate; since I am ready to lay them down, as soon as I perceive Thou
requirest them at my hands. Nevertheless, O Father, if Thou be willing,
remove this cup from me; but if not, Thy will be done.”</p>
</div>

<p>What was the spirit of the ancient martyrs if this was not?</p>

<p>5. A fifth publication, “Hymns for Times of Trouble and
Persecution” (12mo, forty-seven pages), was issued in the
names of “John and Charles Wesley” unitedly. It contains
thirteen hymns for times of trouble; sixteen for times of
persecution; and four to be sung in a tumult.</p>

<p>The remainder of Wesley’s publications, during the present
year, were collections or abridgments of the works of other
authors, namely:—</p>

<p>1. “A Collection of Moral and Sacred Poems from the
most celebrated English authors.” Three volumes, 1024
pages, in 12mo. The work is dedicated to “the right
honourable the Countess of Huntingdon.” Wesley truly
observes, that there is nothing in the collection “contrary
to virtue; nothing that can in any way offend the chastest
ear, or give pain to the tenderest heart. Whatever is really
essential to the most sublime divinity, as well as the purest
and most refined morality, will be found therein. The most
just and important sentiments are here represented with all
the ornaments both of wit and language, and in the clearest,
fullest, strongest light.”</p>

<p>“There is,” writes Mr. Marriott,<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> “a circumstance little
known regarding this ‘Collection.’ A few months after the
publication of these volumes, Dodsley (the publisher) called
upon Wesley for reparation of a piracy, which the latter had
unwittingly committed, and for which he agreed to pay him
£50.” This was done on February 8, 1745, by payment of a £20
bank note, and a cheque for £30, payable in three months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span></p>

<p>2. “A Brief Account of the occasion, process, and issue of a
late Trial at the Assize held at Gloucester, 3rd March, 1743.
Between some of the people called Methodists, Plaintiffs, and
certain Persons of Minchinhampton, in the said county, Defendants.
Extracted from Mr. Whitefield’s Letter. By John
Wesley.” Twelve pages, 12mo.</p>

<p>This was a sort of companion tract to “Modern Christianity
at Wednesbury.” Appended is “a prayer for his majesty
King George,” in ten verses of four lines each, which, in a
somewhat altered form, is now the 465th hymn in the
Methodist Hymn-Book.</p>

<p>3. “A Collection of Prayers for Families.” 12mo, 24
pages.</p>

<p>Wesley considered family religion as indispensable to the
preservation and extension of the work of God. Some of the
first Methodists neglected it; and, as a consequence, their
children shook off all religion and abandoned themselves
to wickedness.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> “Family religion,” said Wesley, twenty
years after this, “is the grand desideratum among the
Methodists.”<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>To promote this, Wesley published his “Prayers for
Families,” in 1744. The prayers are only fourteen in number;
that is, a prayer for every morning and every evening during
a single week; but anything more devout, scriptural,
appropriate, and religiously rich it would be difficult to
conceive.</p>

<p>4. “The Case of John Nelson, written by himself.
Published by John Wesley.” 12mo, 36 pages.</p>

<p>5. “An Extract of Count Zinzendorf’s Discourses on the
Redemption of Man by the Death of Christ.” 12mo,
78 pages.</p>

<p>These loosely worded “Discourses,” sixteen in number, were
first published in 1740, in 12mo, two hundred and two
pages. They were all founded upon Luther’s explanation
of the second article of the Apostles’ creed; “I believe in
Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord.”</p>

<p>6. “A Serious Call to a Holy Life. Extracted from a late
author.” 12mo, 230 pages. This was an abridgment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
well known work of William Law, and was printed by John
Gooding, of Newcastle upon Tyne. It consists of nineteen
chapters, dwelling on Christian devotion; the duties of all
orders and ranks of men and women, of all ages, to practise
it; the happiness arising from doing so; and recommendations
in reference to it.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give the reader, by any brief description
here, an adequate idea of this powerful and pungent book.
He must read it for himself. When will the young people
of the present day, imbibing the froth of sensational writing,
learn that books, like wine, are none the worse for being old?</p>

<p>7. “The Life of God in the Soul of Man; or, the Nature
and Excellency of the Christian Religion.” 12mo, forty-eight
pages.</p>

<p>This was an extract from an excellent treatise, written by
the Rev. Henry Scougal, a Scottish minister, who died at the
early age of twenty-eight, in the year 1678. The book
breathes the sublimest piety; and, in style, is pure and
elegant.</p>

<p>8. “The Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of
God. Extracted from Mr. Edwards, minister of Northampton,
in New England.” 12mo, 48 pages.</p>

<p>By publishing this calm, pointed, argumentative treatise,
Wesley made its sentiments his own; and, from it, the reader
may easily infer what were Wesley’s opinions respecting the
religious revival with which he and his contemporaries were
connected. (See page <a href="#Page_218">218</a>.) The following is a synopsis of
the answers to objections.</p>

<p>It is no sign, that a work is not Divine, because it is
carried on in a way unusual and extraordinary. The Spirit
is sovereign in His operations. We ought not to limit God
where He has not limited Himself. Neither is a work to be
judged by any effects on the bodies of men; such as tears,
trembling, groans, loud outcries, agonies, or faintings; for
there is reason to believe, that great outpourings of the Spirit,
both in the prophetic and apostolic ages, were not wholly
without these extraordinary effects. The same is true
respecting religious commotion among the people, for this is
the natural result of such a work. Further, though many of
the converts may be guilty of great imprudences and irre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>gularities,
neither is this a sign that the work is not the
work of God; for, in a mixed multitude of wise and unwise,
young and old, all under powerful impressions, no wonder
that some should behave themselves imprudently. It was
thus in the apostolic churches, and this is not unlikely to
continue while weakness is one of the elements of human
nature. There may be errors in judgment, and some delusions
of Satan intermixed with the revival; but that is
not conclusive evidence, that the work in general is not
the work of the Holy Ghost. Some may fall away into
scandalous practices; but, if we look into church history, we
shall find no instance of a great revival of religion but what
has been attended with such relapses. The work may have
been promoted by ministers strongly preaching the terrors of
the law; but what of that? If there really be a hell of
dreadful and never ending torments, ought not those exposed
to it to be earnestly warned of their fearful danger? For
ministers to preach of hell, and warn sinners to avoid it in a
cold, careless, hesitating manner, is to contradict themselves,
and to defeat their own purposes. The manner in which the
thing is said is, in such a case, more effectual than the words
employed. It may be unreasonable to think of frightening a
man to heaven; but it is not unreasonable to endeavour to
frighten him away from hell.</p>

<p>Such, in substance, were the sentiments to which Wesley
affixed his <i>imprimatur</i> in 1744,—sentiments still worth pondering,
because always true.</p>

<p>Great revivals may be, often are, and perhaps must be,
attended with circumstances which enlightened and sober
minded Christians dislike; but rather than be without
revivals, where is the man who loves Christ and the souls of
sinners, who would not gladly crucify his own dislikes?</p>

<p>Twelve months after this, in the year 1745, Wesley,
appealing to men of reason and religion, who were in doubt,
whether the revival then vouchsafed was the work of God,
observed:—“You have all the proof of this you can reasonably
expect or desire. That, in many places, abundance
of notorious sinners are totally reformed, is declared by a
thousand eye and ear witnesses both of their present and past
behaviour. What would you have more? What pretence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
can you have for doubting any longer? Do you delay fixing
your judgment till you see a work of God, without any
stumbling block attending it? That never was yet, nor ever
will. ‘It must needs be that offences will come.’ And scarce
ever was there such a work of God before, with so few as
have attended this.”<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1745<br />

Age  42</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHITEFIELD, during the whole of the year 1745, was
in America. Charles Wesley spent about thirty-eight
weeks in London; and about fourteen in Bristol, Wales,
and the west of England. Wesley himself was nearly five
months in London and its vicinity; about a month in Bristol
and the neighbourhood; two months were spent in a tour to
Cornwall; and four months in two journeys to Newcastle and
the north of England.</p>

<p>Persecution somewhat abated, especially in the form of
printed attacks and scandals; not because Methodism was
less hated, but because the attention of the country was
turned to the dangers arising from the invasion of the popish
Pretender.</p>

<p>In Cornwall, however, Thomas Maxfield was seized for a
soldier, and was put into the dungeon at Penzance. Edward
Greenfield, of St. Just, a tanner, with a wife and seven children,
was arrested under a warrant signed by Dr. Borlase. Wesley
asked what objection there was to this peaceable and inoffensive
man. The answer was, “The man is well enough in
other things; but the gentlemen cannot bear his impudence.
Why, sir, he says he knows his sins are forgiven.” This
Cornish persecution was principally promoted by men like
Borlase and Eustick. The latter came with a warrant for
Wesley’s arrest; but sneaked away from its execution, like
a blustering poltroon. While Wesley was preaching at
Gwennap, two men, raging like maniacs, rode into the midst
of the congregation, and began to lay hold upon the people.
In the midst of the disturbance, Wesley and his friends commenced
singing; when Mr. B. lost his patience, and bawled
to his attendants, “Seize him, seize him. I say, seize the
preacher for his majesty’s service.” The attendants not
moving, he cursed them with the greatest bitterness, leaped
off his horse, caught hold of Wesley’s cassock, crying, “I
take you to serve his majesty.” Wesley walked with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
for three quarters of a mile, when the courage of the bumptious
bravo failed him, and he was glad to let the poor parson
go. The day after this ignoble capture, Wesley was at Falmouth,
where the rabble surrounded the house in which he
was lodging, and roared, “Bring out the Canorum! Where
is the Canorum?” (an unmeaning word which the Cornish
generally used instead of Methodist.) They then forced open
the outer door, and setting their shoulders to the inner one,
cried out, “Avast, lads, avast!” Away went all the hinges;
Wesley stepped into the midst of the privateering mob, and
asked one after another, “To which of you have I done any
wrong? To you? Or you? Or you?” All seemed speechless,
until, thus questioning his furious assailants, Wesley
found himself in the open street, where he cried to the
assembled crowd, “Neighbours, countrymen! Do you desire
to hear me speak?” “Yes, yes,” they answered vehemently;
“he shall speak, he shall; no one shall hinder him!”
Meanwhile, Mr. Thomas, the clergyman, and some other
gentlemen came up; Wesley was rescued; his horse was
sent before him to Penryn; he was despatched by water;
and an item of nine shillings and some odd pence appeared
in the parochial accounts “for driving the Methodists out of
the parish.”<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s troubles, however, were not ended. His enemies
ran along the shore to receive him at his landing. Wesley
there confronted them, and, speaking to their leader, said,
“I wish you a good night;” to which the wretch replied,
“I wish you were in hell,” and then turned away with his
companions. Wesley mounted his horse, and hurried forward
to Tolcarn, where he had to preach the same evening. On
the way, five well dressed horsemen were awaiting him, with
a special warrant, from the Helstone magistrates, for his arrest.
He rode into the midst of them, and announced who he was.
A friendly clergyman, Mr. Collins, of Redruth, accidentally
came by, and told the gentlemen that he had known Wesley
at the Oxford university. Conversation followed, and Wesley
was allowed to proceed upon his journey; one of those who
had come out for his arrest telling him, that the reason of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
all this annoyance was, that all the gentlemen round about
affirmed, that, for a long time, he had been in France and
Spain; was now sent to England by the Pretender, and was
raising societies to join him at his coming.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, Wesley courageously rode to and
fro, preaching from, “Love your enemies;” “Watch and
pray;” and, “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall
suffer persecution.” At Tolcarn, while he was preaching, the
mob assembled, and suddenly pushed him from the high
wall on which he was standing. At Trevonan, just after he
had begun his sermon, the constable and others came, and
read the proclamation against riots. At Stithians, the churchwardens
seized one of his hearers, and pressed him for a
soldier.</p>

<p>Whilst these outrages were being perpetrated in Cornwall,
Richard Moss was arrested at Epworth for preaching; but
was delivered through the interference of Mr. Maw, in whose
house he prayed and sang hymns till midnight; and then left
for Robert Taylor’s, at Burnham, where he and the Epworth
Methodists continued praying and praising God, till about
four o’clock in the morning. At Betley, near Nantwich, a
gentleman threatened to hire a mob to pull down the Methodist
meeting-house, and to send all the Methodists for
soldiers. At Bristol, a Methodist backslider declared he
would “make affidavit that he had seen Wesley administer
extreme unction to a woman, and give her a wafer, and say
that was her passport to heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> At Woodley, in Cheshire,
John Bennet and three other Methodists were pressed for
soldiers, most of the press gang being Dissenters. The reverend
Mr. Henry Wickham, one of the magistrates for the
west riding of Yorkshire, issued a warrant to the constable
of Keighley, “to convey the body of Jonathan Reeves to his
majesty’s gaol and castle of York;” the only crime of which
Jonathan was guilty being that of calling sinners to repentance;
though the reverend magistrate chose to describe him
as “a spy among us, and a dangerous man to the person and
government of his majesty King George.”<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> In Exeter, says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
<i>The London Evening Post</i>, for May 16, 1745, the Methodists
had a meeting-house behind the Guildhall; and, on May 6,
the mob gathered at the door, and pelted those who entered
with potatoes, mud, and dung. On coming out, the congregation
were all beaten, without exception; many were
trampled under foot; many fled without their hats and wigs;
and some without coats, or with half of them torn to tatters.
Some of the women were lamed, and others stripped naked,
and rolled most indecently in the kennel, their faces being
besmeared with lampblack, flour, and dirt. This disgraceful
mob consisted of some thousands of cowardly blackguards,
and the disturbance was continued till midnight. The same
newspaper, in its number issued on May 25, relates, with a
sneer, that a Methodist vagrant had been apprehended at
Frome; that he was a person of “very ill fame,” and was
committed to prison; but another of the same sect, “a Scotchman,
a travelling apostle,” had succeeded him, and was
meeting with surprising success. He had already wrought
several miracles, one of which was making a deaf old woman
hear angels playing on celestial harps in the upper regions;
and another was that of converting his own oatmeal into
cake, and transforming his water into wine. He also cured
distempers of the body as well as of the mind; though he often
killed the one with his drugs, to save the other with
his doctrine. The <i>Westminster Journal</i> for June 8, 1745,
narrates that a noted Methodist preacher, named Tolly, had
been pressed for a soldier in Staffordshire, and had appeared
before the magistrates, attended by many of his “deluded
followers of both sexes, who pretended he was a learned and
holy man; and yet, it appeared that he was only a journeyman
joiner, and had done great mischief among the colliers.”
The poor luckless joiner was, therefore, coupled to a sturdy
tinker, and sent off to Stafford jail. He had already been
pressed once before, and the Methodists had subscribed £40
to obtain his freedom, and were intending to repeat the
kindness; but the impeccable editor of the <i>Westminster
Journal</i> hopes that the magistrates will be proof against
golden bribes; for “such wretches” as Tolly “are incendiaries
in a nation,” and greatly to be dreaded.</p>

<p>These were the chief acts of violence committed against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
the Methodists in 1745. As already stated, the press was
still employed, though it was not so bitter as it had been
previously. Newspapers and magazines found that news
about the Pretender’s invasion was more taking with the
public than elaborated diatribes against Wesley and his
friends. During the year, however, there was published,
by a clergyman unknown to fame, an octavo pamphlet of
eighty pages, with the title:—“An Apology for the Clergy,
in a Letter to a Gentleman of Fortune and great Reading,
lately turned Methodist and Hermit; wherein is shown the
weakness of those Objections, which Separatists in general
pretend first induced them to leave the Established Church,
and to look out for better guides somewhere else. By
J. Maud, M.A., vicar of St. Neots, in the county of Huntingdon.”
Mr. Maud alleges, that there is a powerful confederacy
against the Church,—“a mixed multitude of
Socinians, Presbyterians, Independents, Quakers, Anabaptists,
Antinomians, Meer Moralists, Jesuits, Free Thinkers, and
Methodists, and an infinite tribe of nameless sects, all
hallooed on by the vicar of Jesus Christ and his creatures, to
tear Christians to pieces, and to make sport for infidels and
atheists.” The pamphlet is a spirited defence of the clergy,
whom the “Methodist and Hermit” had libelled, and an attempt
to show, that it was no trivial matter to be a faultless
minister of Christ in an age when it was considered “a rude
affront to any polite audience to tell men of their faults, or
so much as to mention these harsh and dreadful sounding
words, hell, damnation, devil, without a canting paraphrase,
or a formal apology.”</p>

<p>A second pamphlet, published in 1745, was, “The Question,
Whether it be right to turn Methodist, considered in a
Dialogue between two members of the Church of England.”
8vo, 79 pages. The Methodists are branded as “unskilful
teachers, doing great mischief to the peace of the Church,
and to the souls of poor, ignorant people; by raising vain
janglings about regeneration; by resolving all religion into
instantaneous faith, and faith itself into impulses and mere
animal sensations; by setting aside all necessity for repentance;
and by casting off <i>all</i> works, as unnecessary to salvation.”
The pamphlet is ably written; but is extremely false.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span></p>

<p>Another attack on Methodism was one published in the
<i>Craftsman</i>, of June 22, and copied in the <i>London Magazine</i>
and other periodicals of the period. It was, in fact, an onslaught
upon the government of the day, entitled “Ministerial
Methodism, or Methodists in Politics;” but, in castigating
ministers of state, it grossly calumniates ministers of Christ.
The Methodists are an “unaccountable strange sect, whose
religion is founded on madness and folly.” They “hold, that
there is no justification by good works, but by faith and grace
only; and hereby banish that Divine part of our constitution,
reason; and cut off the most essential recommendation
to heaven, virtue.” By this “depraved doctrine” of “weak and,
perhaps, designing teachers, misguided souls are dangerously
led astray.” The “men are far gone in their mad principles
of religion, suspend the hand of industry, become inactive,
and leave all to Providence, without exercising either their
heads or hands.”</p>

<p>The article, though neatly written, was supremely silly:
Wesley, at the urgent request of his friends, answered it;<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
but the thing was far more contemptible than some other attacks
which had been allowed; properly enough, to pass
unnoticed.</p>

<p>Another anti-Methodist publication, issued in 1745, was entitled,
“An Earnest and Affectionate Address to the People
called Methodists.” 12mo, 47 pages. This was published
by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and was
distributed gratuitously.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Its author, an old antagonist, was
the Rev. Dr. Stebbing.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> Two editions were exhausted in
1745, and a third sent out in 1746. It allows the Methodists
to be honest and well meaning; but they are “greatly imposed
upon,” and “ignorantly serve the designs of enthusiasm,
and give credit to the most extravagant and groundless pretences.”
The writer proceeds, with considerable ability, to
examine the Methodist doctrines of regeneration, justification
by faith alone, and the operations of the Holy Spirit; and
concludes by saying that, though the Methodist teachers at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
first were only distinguished by “a peculiar strictness and
regularity, and a decent observance of the rules of the Church,
it was not long that they kept within these bounds. Being
admired and followed, they became vain and conceited, and
proceeded to open censures and contempt of their brethren.
They grew loud and furious in their accusations and railings.
They made most presumptuous pretences to Divine communications
and directions;” and, when “their errors were
pointed out, by some of the highest and most considerable
of the clergy, with all possible meekness and temper, their
answers were saucy and petulant. Fresh bitterness arose;
more arrogant boasting; and more uncharitable revilings.
They seized a pulpit or two without leave; and, in defiance of
the law, exercised their ministry in fields and commons, and
other unlicensed places. They set aside and altered the
liturgy at their pleasure, and made use of extempore effusions
of their own in the public worship of God.”</p>

<p>Such were some of the allegations brought against Wesley
and his friends at the instance of the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge.</p>

<p>Another pamphlet, published in the same year, was “A
Serious Address to Lay-Methodists to beware of the false
pretences of their Teachers. With an Appendix containing an
account of the fatal and bloody effects of enthusiasm, in the
case of the family of the Dutartres in South Carolina, which
was attended with the murder of two persons, and the execution
of four for those murders. By a Sincere Protestant.”
8vo, 29 pages.</p>

<p>This was a frothy composition, asserting that “the
Methodist preachers are wandering lights, gadding about with
canting assurances, and leading people into bogs of delusion.”
Its author was Dr. Zachary Grey, already mentioned (page 325)
as the author of “The Quakers and Methodists compared.”<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>Besides all these attacks, Wesley had to endure much
Moravian annoyance. At the commencement of the year,
desiring to see once more his old friend Gambold, he called
at James Hutton’s, and there met Mr. Simpson, “extremely
gay, easy, and unconcerned;” “a new creature indeed! but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
not in the gospel sense.” Mr. Simpson, unhappily, was a
specimen of others. The Moravians meant well; but they
held and preached the grand old doctrine of salvation by
<i>faith only</i>, so unguardedly that, as a matter of course, the
rank weed of antinomianism sprung out of the soil of Christian
truth. Antinomianism, according to Wesley, was now a
torrent; not only in London but out of it. At Bristol,
Wesley writes, “the Antinomians had taken true pains to
seduce those who were showing their faith by their works;
but they reaped little fruit of their bad labour; for, upon the
most diligent inquiry, I could not find that seven persons out
of seven hundred had been turned out of the old Bible way.”
Whitefield, writing from America, remarks: “Antinomianism,
I find, begins to show its head, and stalk abroad. May the
glorious Redeemer cause it to hide its head again; and prevent
His children’s spirits being embittered against each other.”<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
In August, James Hutton, by order of Zinzendorf, published,
in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, an advertisement, declaring that the
Moravians had no connection with the two Wesleys; and subjoining
one of the count’s prophecies, that Wesley and his
brother would “soon run their heads against the wall.”
To this Wesley simply said: “We will not, if we can help it.”
Dissensions also had sprung up among the Unitas Fratrum
themselves. Richard Viney had denounced Zinzendorf’s
“more than papal domination;” and large numbers of the
Yorkshire Moravians had sympathised with him. Zinzendorf
was furious, and, in February 1744, wrote from Germany as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hereby declare, that I will have nothing more to do with those
English Brethren, who have been mixed up in Viney’s rebellion. I disapprove
of the absolution that is given to such Corah spirits. I laugh at
the English national self righteousness in matters relating to our salvation.
I desire to be erased from the list of English labourers, and not to
be named among them, until all accomplices in the late revolt make an
acknowledgment in writing of their having been deceived by Satan.</p>

<p>
“The well-known little fool and poor sinner,<br />
<br />
“<span class="smcap">Ludwig</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This was pitiful tomfoolery; the raging of a lilliputian and
disappointed pope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span></p>

<p>During the year, a 12mo pamphlet, of forty-one pages, was
published, with the title, “Extracts of Letters relating to
Methodists and Moravians. By a Layman;” in which the
Moravians are censured—1. For laying aside the use of their
intellectual faculties in <i>religious matters</i>. 2. For refusing
to take oaths before a magistrate. 3. For declining to take
up arms in defence of their country, at the command of the
civil power. And, 4. For their praying to and praising so
constantly the Son of God, and so very seldom the Father.
This was supposed to be written by Sir John Thorold; but
as it makes no attack upon Wesley and his immediate
followers it need not be farther noticed.</p>

<p>Another, and more important publication, was the following:—“Remarks
on the Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s last Journal,
wherein he gives an account of the tenets and proceedings
of the Moravians, especially those in England, and of the
divisions and perplexities of the Methodists: showing, by the
concessions of Mr. Wesley himself, the many errors relating
to faith and practice, which have already arisen among these
deluded people; and, in a particular manner, explaining the
very fatal tendency of denying good works to be conditions of
our justification. In a letter to that gentleman. By Thomas
Church, A.M., vicar of Battersea, and prebendary of St.
Paul’s.” 8vo, 76 pages.</p>

<p>The pamphlet is calmly and ably written, and thus concludes:
“The consequences of Methodism, which have
hitherto appeared, are bad enough to induce you to leave
it. It has introduced many disorders—Enthusiasm, Antinomianism,
Calvinism, a neglect and contempt of God’s
ordinances and almost all other duties, a great increase of our
sects and divisions, and, in fine, presumption and despair in
greater abundance than they were known before.”</p>

<p>The letter is dated, November 3, 1744, and has the following
postscript:—“If you think proper to return any answer,
I hope you will attentively consider the points objected to
you, and not put me off with such a slight, superficial,
declamatory thing as Mr. Whitefield, without any regard to
his own character or the importance of the subject, published
last year under the title of an answer to my letter to him;
in which he did not vouchsafe to consider any one argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
I had urged against him, and which no serious man could
think deserved any notice.”</p>

<p>The “Remarks” deserved an answer. Wesley acknowledged,
in after years, that Church “wrote as a gentleman.”<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> “Mr.
Church,” said he, in 1777, “was another kind of opponent
than Mr. Rowland Hill; a gentleman, a scholar, and a
Christian; and as such he both spoke and wrote.”<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, first of all, Mr. Webb published a letter in
vindication of Wesley’s Journal, in reply to Mr. Church;<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
and then Wesley himself issued a 12mo pamphlet of forty-six
pages, entitled, “An Answer to the Rev. Mr. Church’s
Remarks on the Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s last Journal.”</p>

<p>Wesley thus begins:—“Reverend sir,—My first desire
and prayer to God is, that I may live peaceably with all
men: my next, that if I must dispute at all, it may be with a
man of understanding. Thus far, I rejoice on the present
occasion. I rejoice also, that I have confidence of your
sincerity, of your real desire to promote the glory of God,
by peace and goodwill among men. I am likewise thankful
to God for your calm manner of writing (a few paragraphs
excepted); and yet more for this,—that such an opponent
should, by writing in such a manner, give me an opportunity
of explaining myself on those very heads whereon I wanted
an occasion so to do.”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to say, that he wholly disapproved of the
doctrines, “that there are no degrees in faith; that, in order
to attain faith, we must abstain from all the ordinances of
God; that a believer does not grow in holiness; and that
he is not obliged to keep the commandments of God;” but,
at the same time, he remarks, that he had already cleared the
<i>Moravian church</i> from the charge of holding the first of these
doctrines; that, with respect to the ordinances of God, their
practice was better than their principle; and that he never
knew a Moravian, except Molther, who affirmed that a
believer does not grow in holiness. “Still,” he adds, “I am
afraid their whole church is tainted with quietism, universal
salvation, and antinomian opinions.” “As a church, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
exalted themselves above measure, and despised others. He
had scarce heard one Moravian brother own his church to be
wrong in anything. Many of them he had heard speak of
it, as if it were infallible; and some of them had set it up as
the judge of all the earth, of all persons as well as doctrines.
Some had said, there was no true church but theirs, and that
there were no true Christians out of it. These were exceeding
great mistakes; yet in as great mistakes holy men
had both lived and died;—Thomas à Kempis, for instance,
and Francis Sales.” He condemns them for “despising and
decrying self denial; for their extending Christian liberty
beyond all warrant of holy writ; for their want of zeal for
good works; and, above all, for their using guile;” but he
wishes not to condemn all for the sake of some, and expresses
the belief that, next to some thousands in the Church of
England, that is mainly the Methodists, the Moravians, with
whom he had formed acquaintance, were, upon the whole, the
best Christians in the world. They had much evil among
them, but more good. They were the most self inconsistent
people now existing; and yet he could not help but speak of
them with tender affection, were it only for the benefits he
had received from them; and, if the stumbling blocks above
mentioned were put away, he should desire union with them
above all things under heaven.</p>

<p>After this, Wesley gives his latest thoughts upon justification
by faith alone, as published in his “Farther Appeal to
Men of Reason and Religion,” which will be noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>In reply to Church’s assertion, that Wesley was guilty
of enthusiasm to the highest degree, Wesley remarks, that he
is no more like Church’s picture of an enthusiast than he is
like a centaur. He made the word of God the rule of all his
actions, and no more followed any secret impulse instead
thereof, than he followed Mahommed or Confucius. He rested
not on ecstasies at all, for he never felt them; but judged
of his spiritual estate by the improvement of his heart and the
tenour of his life conjointly. He desired neither his dreams
nor his waking thoughts to be at all regarded, unless just so
far as they agreed with the oracles of God.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Moravians, reference must be made
to another pamphlet, issued in 1745. “A Short View of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>
Difference between the Moravian Brethren lately in England
and the Rev. Mr. John and Charles Wesley. Extracted
chiefly from a late Journal. London: printed by W. Strahan.
Sold at the Foundery, etc. 1745.” 12mo, 24 pages. The
pamphlet is dated, May 20, 1745, and is signed by both
the Wesleys. Appended are six hymns bearing on the
subject. The differences are contained in ten propositions;
but having been referred to so frequently in the preceding
pages, it is scarcely necessary to repeat them here. Suffice it
to say, that the publication of these “Differences” was probably
owing to the publication of Church’s remarks on
Wesley’s Journal; and, that it was one, if not the main,
reason of Zinzendorf and Hutton publishing, in the <i>Daily
Advertiser</i>, that the Moravians had now no connection with
the Wesleys. Wesley, in his pamphlet, uses language more
than ordinarily strong. He pronounces several of the Moravian
dogmas “utterly false.” He declares, that Zinzendorf’s definition
of faith, namely, the historical knowledge that Christ
has been a man and suffered death for us, “is a proposition
directly subversive of the whole of the Christian revelation;”
and that his doctrine, that “a believer is not holy <i>in himself</i>,
but in Christ only,” is “a palpable self contradiction, and
senseless jargon.” Zinzendorf’s temper was touchy, and it is
not surprising, that he resented Wesley’s plain speaking,
and commanded Hutton to publish the advertisement just
mentioned.</p>

<p>The controversy still continued; and, during 1745, two
other tracts were published by Wesley. (1) “A Dialogue
between an Antinomian and his friend.” 12mo, 12 pages.
(2) “A Second Dialogue between an Antinomian and his
friend.” 12mo, 12 pages.</p>

<p>In both these tracts, the monstrousness of the Moravian
and other errors is mercilessly exposed and censured. “All
that is really uncommon in your doctrine,” says Wesley to his
antinomian friend, “is a heap of broad absurdities, in most
of which you grossly contradict yourselves, as well as Scripture
and common sense. In the meantime, you boast and vapour,
as if <i>ye were the men, and wisdom should die with you</i>. I
pray God to humble you, and prove you, and show you what
is in your heart!”</p>

<p>This was partly written in answer to a Dialogue that had
been published by William Cudworth, who was, for some
years, a follower of Whitefield, and then became minister of an
Independent congregation, in Margaret Street, London, and
died in 1763.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> The biographer of the Countess of Huntingdon
states, that Cudworth “died in the comforts of the doctrines
of grace, leaving behind him a character for eminent
holiness and integrity.”<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Wesley’s description of the man is
widely different; but, if Wesley ever felt the least bitterness
towards any of his opponents, it was towards Cudworth.
He describes him as an Antinomian; an absolute, avowed
enemy to the law of God, which he never preached, or
professed to preach, but termed all legalists who did. With
him, preaching the law was an abomination. He would
preach Christ, as he called it, but without one word either of
holiness or good works.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cudworth will again cross our path. Suffice it to say
here, that, between him and Wesley, no love was lost.
Affection for him was at zero; and he abhorred Wesley “as
much as he did the pope, and ten times more than he did the
devil.”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>As already stated, Wesley made, during 1745, two journeys
to Newcastle and the north of England.</p>

<p>The first of these was commenced on the 18th of February,
and lasted to the 11th of May. Richard Moss was his
companion, and not a few were the adventures with which
they met. Locomotion was rendered extremely difficult in
consequence of snow. In some places, a thaw, succeeded
by a frost, had made the ground like glass; and often they
were obliged to walk, it being impossible to ride, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
horses frequently falling, even while they were leading
them. At Gateshead Fell, the whole country appeared
a great pathless waste of white; and, but for an honest man
who became their guide, they knew not how to reach Newcastle.
Wesley writes:—“Many a rough journey have I had
before, but one like this I never had; between wind, and hail,
and rain, and ice, and snow, and driving sleet, and piercing
cold: but it is past; these days will return no more, and are
therefore as though they had never been.” This rough
journey of two hundred and eighty miles was performed on
horseback, in six days, at the rate of nearly fifty miles a
day.</p>

<p>The besetting sin of the Newcastle Methodists was the
being offended with each other; and Wesley’s first work was
to reconcile wrangling neighbours. On the second Sunday
after his arrival, a brutal bully, who had been accustomed to
abuse the Orphan House family, and to throw stones at them,
assaulted Wesley in Pilgrim Street, and cursed and pushed
him. The next day the following characteristic note was
sent:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Robert Young</span>,—I expect to see you between this and Friday, and
to hear from you, that you are sensible of your fault; otherwise, in pity to
your soul, I shall be obliged to inform the magistrates of your assaulting
me yesterday in the street.</p>

<p class="psig">
“I am, your real friend,<br />
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Robert Young immediately came, and meekly begged
pardon, and promised to amend his ways.</p>

<p>On the 11th of March, Wesley wrote a long letter to a
friend, giving an account of the way in which the Methodist
societies had sprung into existence, and then stating succinctly
the present position of himself and his coadjutors. They were
willing to make any concession, which their conscience would
permit, in order to heal the breach between the clergy and
themselves; but they could not desist from preaching the
doctrine of inward and present salvation, as attainable by
faith alone; nor could they promise not to preach in private
houses, or in the open air; for, as things were now circumstanced,
this would amount to a promise not to preach at all.
They could not, with a safe conscience, dissolve their societies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>
for they apprehended that many souls would be lost thereby;
neither could they advise the members one by one, their
number rendering this impossible. They could not suffer
those who walked disorderly still to mingle with the rest,
because evil communications corrupt good manners; nor
could they discharge the leaders, because it was through the
leaders that disorderly walkers were detected. While they
were resolved to behave with reverence towards the bishops of
the Church, and with tenderness both to the character and
persons of the inferior clergy, they desired not to be admitted
to their pulpits, if they believed them to be preachers of false
doctrine, or had the least scruple of conscience concerning
this; but, at the same time, they desired that those clergymen
who believed their doctrines to be true, and had no
scruple at all in the matter, should not be either publicly or
privately discouraged from inviting them to preach in their
churches. If any one thought them heretics or schismatics,
and deemed it his duty to preach or print against them, be it
so; they had not the least objection; but, before doing so,
they desired that he would calmly consider both sides of the
question, and not condemn them unheard. If they were
guilty of either Popery, sedition, or immorality, they desired no
favour; but they also desired, that senseless tales concerning
them should not be credited without proof. They desired not
any preferment, favour, or recommendation, from authorities
either in Church or state; but they asked—1. That, if anything
material were laid to their charge, they might be
permitted to answer for themselves. 2. That the clergy and
magistrates would hinder their dependants from stirring up
the rabble against them. And, 3. That they would effectually
suppress, and thoroughly discountenance, all riots and popular
insurrections, which evidently strike at the foundation of all
government, whether of Church or state.</p>

<p>Such was Wesley’s position in 1745. Though the document
was not published in his Journal for eight years afterwards,
it was, in fact, a manifesto defining his relations to Church
and state, and the course of action he felt it his duty
to pursue; and, viewed in such a light, it is of great
importance.</p>

<p>During his stay at Newcastle, Wesley received and enter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>tained
a strange visitor in his Orphan House. This was none
other than a popish priest. Twelve months before, a royal
proclamation had been published, ordering the laws against
papists to be enforced, and commanding all such religionists
to depart from the cities of London and Westminster; and
likewise forbidding them to leave their country homes, in any
direction, for more than five miles’ distance. This proclamation
was occasioned by the preparations that were being made
by the young Pretender to invade Great Britain. Papists, and
especially papistical priests, were regarded, by the general
public, with suspicion and abhorrence. This was natural.
Their disloyalty to the house of Hanover was a well known
fact; and their intrigues, in favour of the Stuart family,
were now culminating in the approaching invasion on behalf
of the eldest son of James II. Under such circumstances,
it was a bold, we think an imprudent, act for Wesley to
make a priest of the Church of Rome his guest. Still
the visit led to results which, to the writer at least, are
interesting.</p>

<p>The priest’s name was Adams, or Watson Adams. His
home was at Osmotherley (the author’s native place), a
village of about a thousand inhabitants, sixty miles south of
Newcastle. The place had been famous as a papistical
settlement, and was still resorted to by not a few adherents
of that religion. The writer’s grandmother, for a long
series of years, walked, every Sunday morning, over a bleak,
roadless moor, full of bogs and pitfalls, a distance of at
least twelve miles there and back, for the purpose of attending,
in Osmotherley chapel, the reading of a few Latin
prayers, not a word of which had she scholarship enough
to understand. Here had been an important convent of
Franciscan friars, the chapel of which was still standing.
In the immediate neighbourhood were the ruins of another
popish edifice, known by the name of “the Lady’s
chapel”; and, within a mile, were the beautiful and extensive
remains of Mount Grace, a Carthusian priory, founded
in 1396.</p>

<p>Wesley’s account of the priest’s visit is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“March 28.—A gentleman called at our house, and said, that he lived
at Osmotherley, in Yorkshire; and had heard so many strange accounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
of the Methodists, that he could not rest till he came to inquire for
himself. I told him he was welcome to stay as long as he pleased, if he
could live on our Lenten fare. He made no difficulty of this, and willingly
stayed till the Monday sennight following; when he returned home, fully
satisfied with his journey.”</p>
</div>

<p>The odd acquaintance thus begun was perpetuated. A
week after this (on Easter Monday), Wesley began the day
by preaching, at half-past four o’clock, to a large congregation,
including “many of the rich and honourable.” He then
set out for London, and, at eight o’clock, preached in the
open air, to “a large and quiet congregation,” at Chester-le-street.
Starting again, he reached Northallerton in the
evening, and made the inn his preaching place. The priest,
Adams, and some of his neighbours, including Elizabeth
Tyerman, a Quakeress, formed part of his congregation. The
priest wished Wesley to come and preach in his house at
Osmotherley. The invitation was at once accepted; Wesley
mounted; and, travelling up hill and down hill, seven miles
more, reached the village a little before ten at night; having
ridden during the day, over execrable roads, a distance of
at least sixty miles, and preached thrice. Of course, at this
season of the year, it had long been dark; and, in a village so
sequestered, most of the inhabitants had retired to rest; but
the priest and his friends went round the place, and, arousing
the people, succeeded, in about an hour, in collecting a congregation
in the chapel which formerly belonged to the Franciscan
friars. Wesley preached to them, and, after midnight,
went to bed, feeling, as he expressed it, “no weariness at all.”
At five in the morning, he preached again, on Romans iii.
22, a sermon, in a popish chapel, on the great anti-popish
doctrine of justification by faith alone, part of the congregation
having sat up all night for fear they should not awake in
sufficient time to hear him. Many of them either were or
had been papists, and one who was present was the Quakeress
already mentioned. After the sermon, this unbaptized woman,
abruptly addressing Wesley, asked, “Dost thou think water
baptism an ordinance of Christ?” Wesley replied, “What
saith Peter? ‘Who can forbid water, that these should not be
baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost even as we?’”
Wesley adds: “I spoke but little more, before she cried out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
‘’Tis right! ’tis right! I will be baptized.’ And so she was,
the same hour.“<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>On reaching Leeds, a week afterwards, Wesley wrote, as
follows, to his brother Charles.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Leeds</span>, <i>April 23, 1745</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,—It was time for me to give them the ground at
Newcastle, and to fly for my life. I grew more and more honourable
every day: the rich and great flocking to us together, so that many times
the room would not hold them. Iniquity, for the present, hath stopped
her mouth; and it is almost fashionable to speak well of us. In all
appearance, if I had stayed a month longer, the mayor and aldermen
would have been with us.”</p>
</div>

<p>He then proceeds to give an account of his journey to
Northallerton, where he found “a noble people, who received
the word with all readiness of mind”; and of his setting out for
Osmotherley, where he says: “I preached in a large chapel
which belonged, a few years since, to a convent of Franciscan
friars. I found I was got into the very centre of all the
papists in the north of England. ‘<i>Commessatorem haud satis
commodum.</i>’ This also hath God wrought.”<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>Thus began Methodism in Osmotherley, Wesley preaching
the first sermon, in a popish chapel, at eleven o’clock at night,
having been brought to the place by a popish priest and a
Quaker woman. A society was formed soon after, the original
class papers and society book of which, for 1750, and onwards,
are still in existence. Four years afterwards, a chapel was
erected, which still stands, and which, up to the year 1865,
for the long period of one hundred and eleven years, was
uninterruptedly occupied as a Methodist place of worship,
being, with one exception (Coleford, in Somersetshire), the
oldest Methodist chapel in the world, continuously used as
such. In it, the writer was converted, and painfully he
regrets that, in the present mania for new chapels, the society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
without the least necessity, were barbarous enough to quit it
for a more modern structure, not a whit more adapted to
their church necessities, and, of course, destitute of the unequalled
memories belonging to the ugly, but venerable pile,
now, we fear, left to rats and ruin.</p>

<p>Osmotherley, nestled beneath moorland mountains, was one
of Wesley’s favourite haunts. Though seven miles from the
direct road between London and Newcastle, and a place
difficult to reach, he paid at least sixteen visits to the place to
which he was so strangely introduced. Nor did he forget or
neglect his old friend, the popish priest. His house, on some
occasions, was Wesley’s home. When he visited him, in 1776,
he found him “just quivering over the grave”; and, at his
visit a year later, he writes:—“I found my old friend was just
dead, after living a recluse life near fifty years. From one
that attended him, I learned that the sting of death was
gone, and he calmly delivered up his soul to God.”</p>

<p>Leaving a place, for lingering too long at which the writer
craves forbearance, we must follow Wesley in his evangelistic
wanderings. He made his way to Sykehouse, to Epworth,
and to Grimsby, at which last mentioned town he preached
to a “stupidly rude and noisy congregation, encouraged
thereto by a drunken alehouse keeper.” At Epworth, he
preached at the market cross, having most of the adults in
the town to hear him. He went to his father’s church, and
there heard his old acquaintance, John Romley, preach a
sermon which, “from beginning to end, was a railing
accusation.” He returned to Leeds, Armley, Birstal, and
Bradford.</p>

<p>Leaving the west riding, he made a tour in Lancashire,
Cheshire, and Derbyshire, and then came round to Sheffield,
where he preached on the floor of the Methodist meeting-house,
“which the good Protestant mob had just pulled
down,” to the largest and one of the quietest Sheffield
congregations he had ever seen. He then made his way to
Nottingham, Wednesbury, and Birmingham, at the last of
which places “stones and dirt were flying from every side,
almost without intermission, for near an hour.” On Saturday,
May 11, he got to London, from which he had been absent
about twelve weeks. Here he found things in an unsatis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>factory
state. There were more than two thousand members,
above two thirds of whom were women.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> “The sower of
tares had not been idle. Many were shaken; and some,
who once seemed pillars, were moved from their steadfastness.”
Numbers were “hugely in love” with what
Wesley calls, “that solemn trifle, Robert Barclay’s Apology.”
This he and his brother read over with them. “Their
eyes were opened; they saw Barclay’s nakedness, and were
ashamed.”</p>

<p>Having employed a month in London, Wesley set out for
Cornwall, where he spent the next five weeks. The persecutions
he encountered have been related at the commencement
of the present chapter. Suffice it to remark here, that,
during this Cornish tour, he did what he was rarely permitted
to do elsewhere; he preached in not fewer than four
churches, with the consent, or at the request, of their
respective ministers. An odd event also happened to him at
St. Just, where, as he himself was about to begin to preach, a
kind of gentlewoman took his place, and “scolded, screamed,
spit, and stamped, wrung her hands and distorted her face,”
most violently. She had been bred a papist, and had
been rejoiced to hear that Wesley was one; but, being now
undeceived and disappointed, her anger was quite equal to
what her joy had been. Like a true philosopher, Wesley let
the vociferous lady have all the talking to herself, and “took
no notice of her at all, good or bad.” Wesley returned to
London on August 16.</p>

<p>Terrible was the national excitement which now existed. A
few weeks before, Charles Edward Stuart had embarked from
Brittany, with about fifty of his Scotch and Irish adherents,
and had set up his standard in Scotland, emblazoned with the
motto, “<i>Tandem triumphans</i>.” On the 4th of September, he
proclaimed his father in the town of Perth; within a fortnight,
he entered Edinburgh; and, a few days afterwards, fought
the royal troops at Preston Pans, and was victorious. Under
the pretentious title of “regent of the kingdoms of England,
Scotland, France, and Ireland,” he marched his increasing
forces to Carlisle, Lancaster, Manchester, and Derby; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
was then driven back to Scotland, where, on April 16, 1746,
was fought the decisive battle of Culloden. These brief
remarks will help to illustrate Wesley’s Journal.</p>

<p>Five days after the proclamation of the Pretender, namely,
on September 9, Wesley set out from London to Newcastle.
On his way he called upon Doddridge, the great
Dissenter, and addressed his students. His purpose was to
go round by Epworth; but, “hearing of more and more
commotions in the north,” he hastened to Newcastle. At
Leeds, the mob pelted him and his society with dirt and
stones, and were “ready to knock out all their brains for
joy that the Duke of Tuscany was emperor.” At Osmotherley,
he took occasion to visit the Carthusian priory, already
mentioned; and, after describing the walls, cells, and gardens,
expressed a sentiment which, however just, was at that
time far from being popular:—“Who knows but some of
the poor superstitious monks, who once served God here
according to the light they had, may meet us, by-and-by, in
that house of God, ‘not made with hands, eternal, in the
heavens’?” On September 18, he reached Newcastle, in,
what he calls, an “acceptable time.”</p>

<p>News had just arrived that the Pretender had entered
Edinburgh. The inhabitants were in the utmost consternation.
Wesley at once commenced preaching, selecting as his text,
“Who can tell, if God will return, and repent, and turn away
from His fierce anger, that we perish not?” The <i>Newcastle
Courant</i>, for September 14 to September 21, is before us,
containing an account of an association of his majesty’s
Protestant subjects in Ireland, pledging their faith and
honour, that they will, at the hazard of their lives and
fortunes, oppose the abominable and unnatural rebellion now
carried on in favour of the popish Pretender. There is also
an address to the king by seven hundred and thirty of the
merchants of London, and from the lord provost, magistrates,
and council of Edinburgh, to the same effect.</p>

<p>The following loyal, if not finished, lines are published:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The day after Wesley’s arrival, Mr. Ridley, the mayor,
summoned all the householders of Newcastle to meet him at
the town hall, and to sign an agreement, to the effect that
they would hazard their goods and lives, in defending the
town against the common enemy. He ordered the townsmen
to be under arms, and to mount guard in turns. Pilgrim
Street gate, just outside of which was Wesley’s Orphan House,
was walled up; and Wesley and his society spent the day in
fasting and in prayer. The agreement submitted by the
mayor, and which was signed by eight hundred and thirteen
inhabitants of the town, was, that they “do voluntarily oblige
themselves to appear in person, or to provide daily, or when
required, an able man to act in concert with his majesty’s
forces in the town, for the defence thereof, against all his
majesty’s enemies.”<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> As Wesley did not accompany the
householders to meet the mayor, he wrote to him the
following letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>To the Worshipful the Mayor of Newcastle.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—My not waiting upon you at the town hall was not owing to
any want of respect. I reverence you for your office’ sake; and much
more for your zeal in the execution of it. I would to God, every
magistrate in the land would copy after such an example! Much less
was it owing to any disaffection to his majesty King George. But I
knew not how far it might be either necessary or proper for me to appear
on such an occasion. I have no fortune at Newcastle: I have only the
bread I eat, and the use of a little room for a few weeks in the year.</p>

<p>“All I can do for his majesty, whom I honour and love,—I think
not less than I did my own father,—is this: I cry unto God, day by day,
in public and in private, to put all his enemies to confusion: and I
exhort all that hear me to do the same; and, in their several stations,
to exert themselves as loyal subjects; who, so long as they fear God,
cannot but honour the king.</p>

<p>“Permit me, sir, to add a few words more, out of the fulness of my
heart. I am persuaded you fear God, and have a deep sense that His
kingdom ruleth over all. Unto whom then (I may ask you), should
we flee for succour, but unto Him whom, by our sins, we have justly
displeased? O, sir, is it not possible to give any check to these overflowings
of ungodliness? to the open, flagrant wickedness, the drunkenness
and profaneness, which so abound, even in our streets? I just take leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
to suggest this. May the God whom you serve direct you in this, and all
things! This is the daily prayer of, sir,</p>

<p class="psig">
“Your obedient servant, for Christ’s sake,<br />
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This was written on September 21, on which day arrived
the news of General Cope’s disastrous defeat at Preston Pans.
Newcastle was seized with panic. Many of the opulent of
the inhabitants fled with the utmost precipitation, taking
their most valuable effects with them. Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“September 22.—The walls are mounted with cannon, and all things
prepared for sustaining an assault. Our poor neighbours, on either hand,
are busy in removing their goods. And most of the best houses in our
street are left without either furniture or inhabitants. Those within the
walls are almost equally busy in carrying away their money and their
goods; and more and more of the gentry every hour ride southward as
fast as they can. At eight, I preached at Gateshead, in a broad part of
the street, near the popish chapel, on the wisdom of God in governing the
world.”</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, part of the Northumberland militia entered the
town, namely, about four hundred horse, and above two
hundred foot,<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> all well armed, and headed by the county
gentlemen. Still the alarms continued, and the storm seemed
nearer every day. “Many,” says Wesley, “wondered we would
still stay without the walls; others told us, we must remove
quickly; for if the cannon began to play from the top of the
gates, they would beat all the house about our ears. This
made me look how the cannon on the gates were planted;
and I could not but adore the providence of God, for it was
obvious—(1) they were all planted in such a manner, that
no shot could touch our house; (2) the cannon on Newgate
so secured us on one side, and those upon Pilgrim Street gate
on the other, that none could come near our house, either
way, without being torn in pieces.”</p>

<p>Amid the most terrible alarms, Wesley continued preaching
in Newcastle, and visiting the country societies round about.
On October 8 he wrote the following characteristic letter to
General Husk:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A surly man came to me this evening, as he said, from you. He
would not deign to come upstairs to me, nor so much as into the house;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>
but stood in the yard till I came, and then obliged me to go with him into
the street, where he said, ‘You must pull down the battlements of your
house, or to-morrow the general will pull them down for you.’</p>

<p>“Sir, to me this is nothing. But I humbly conceive it would not be
proper for this man, whoever he is, to behave in such a manner to
any other of his majesty’s subjects, at so critical a time as this.</p>

<p>“I am ready, if it may be for his majesty’s service, to pull not only the
battlements, but the house down; or to give up any part of it, or the
whole, into your excellency’s hands.”</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the troops already mentioned, the town had been
reinforced by the entrance of six hundred Dutch soldiers,
belonging to the regiment of General de la Rocque; and
gentlemen volunteers had become expert in military exercise,
especially the company with red and pink cockades. All
persons residing outside the walls were ordered to take their
ladders to the town’s yard, and their firearms to the mayor;
and no person was to fire a gun at night under pain of imprisonment.
Two hundred cannon were planted on the town
walls; and the water gates on the quay side were all built up
with gun holes in them.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Wesley, supposing the danger was over for the present,
started off, on October 9, on a short tour to Epworth, leaving
John Trembath to supply his place. At Ferrybridge he
was conducted to General Wentworth, who read all the letters
he had about him. At Doncaster, where he slept, or rather
wished to sleep, he was surrounded by drunken, cursing,
swearing soldiers. At Epworth, he had, for once, the satisfaction
of hearing Mr. Romley preach “an earnest, affectionate
sermon”; while he himself strongly exhorted the society
to “fear God, and honour the king.” He then returned
to Newcastle, by way of Sheffield, Birstal, Leeds, and
Osmotherley, arriving on October 22, after an absence of
thirteen days.</p>

<p>Within a week, the right honourable Fieldmarshal Wade,
and Prince Maurice of Nassau, arrived with about nine
thousand Dutch and English soldiers, which, when added
to General St. George’s dragoons, General Sinclair’s Royal
Scots, and other troops, made about fifteen thousand men, all
encamped upon Newcastle moor.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> With such an influx,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
no wonder that wickedness abounded. Wesley was horrified,
and on October 26 sent to Mr. Ridley, the mayor, the following
letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—The fear of God, the love of my country, and the regard I have
for his majesty King George, constrain me to write a few plain words to
one who is no stranger to these principles of action.</p>

<p>“My soul has been pained day by day, even in walking the streets of
Newcastle, at the senseless, shameless wickedness, the ignorant profaneness,
of the poor men to whom our lives are entrusted. The continual
cursing and swearing, the wanton blasphemy of the soldiers in general,
must needs be a torture to the sober ear, whether of a Christian or an
honest infidel. Can any that either fear God, or love their neighbour,
hear this without concern? especially if they consider the interest of
our country, as well as of these unhappy men themselves. For can it be
expected, that God should be on their side who are daily affronting Him
to His face? And if God be not on their side, how little will either their
number, or courage, or strength avail?</p>

<p>“Is there no man that careth for these souls? Doubtless there are
some who ought so to do. But many of these, if I am rightly informed,
receive large pay, and do just nothing.</p>

<p>“I would to God it were in my power, in any degree, to supply their
lack of service. I am ready to do what in me lies, to call these poor
sinners to repentance, once or twice a day (while I remain in these parts),
at any hour, or at any place. And I desire no pay at all for doing this;
unless what my Lord shall give at His appearing.</p>

<p>“If it be objected (from our heathenish poet), ‘this conscience will
make cowards of us all,’ I answer, let us judge by matter of fact. Let
either friends or enemies speak. Did those who feared God behave
as cowards at Fontenoy? Did John Haime, the dragoon, betray any
cowardice, before or after his horse sunk under him? Or did William
Clements, when he received the first ball in his left, and the second in his
right arm? Or John Evans, when the cannon ball took off both his legs?
Did he not call all about him, as long as he could speak, to praise and
fear God, and honour the king? as one who feared nothing, but lest
his last breath should be spent in vain.</p>

<p>“If it were objected, that I should only fill their heads with peculiar
whims and notions; that might easily be known. Only let the officers
hear with their own ears; and they may judge whether I do not preach
the plain principles of manly, rational religion.</p>

<p>“Having myself no knowledge of the general, I took the liberty to make
this offer to you. I have no interest herein; but I should rejoice to serve,
as I am able, my king and country. If it be judged, that this will be of
no real service, let the proposal die, and be forgotten. But I beg you, sir,
to believe, that I have the same glorious cause, for which you have shown
so becoming a zeal, earnestly at heart; and that therefore, I am, with
warm respect, sir,—</p>

<p class="psig">
Your most obedient servant,<br />
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span></p>

<p>The mayor sent a message, to the effect that he would
communicate the proposal to the general. We are not told
whether the general gave his consent or not; but, five days
afterwards, we find Wesley, in the midst of this huge
encampment, preaching from, “Ho, every one that thirsteth,
come ye to the waters!” “None,” says he, “attempted to
make the least disturbance, from the beginning to the end.
Yet I could not reach their hearts. The words of a scholar
did not affect them, like those of a dragoon or a grenadier.”</p>

<p>In such circumstances, Wesley honestly acknowledges, that
a layman, like John Haime, the brave dragoon, would have
been more effective than himself. This, however, did not discourage
him. The day following, he preached to the troops
again. On this occasion, a lieutenant endeavoured to raise
disturbance; but, when Wesley had finished, tried to make
amends, by telling the soldiers that all that had been said
was very good.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, November 2, his text was, “The
Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise might
be given to them that believe;” and he now began to see
some fruit of his labour. On the Sunday, the camp was again
his cathedral. Abundance of people flocked together, horse
and foot, rich and poor, to whom he declared, “There is no
difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of
God.” He had long laid aside the German tongue, but,
seeing a number of Germans standing disconsolate at the
skirts of the congregation, he also addressed them, the poor
troopers drinking in every word.</p>

<p>This terminated his labours in the camp on Newcastle
moor. The next day he set out for London, and spoiled the
Guy Fawkes holiday in Leeds, by informing the magistrates
that he had met several expresses, sent to countermand the
march of the army into Scotland; and that the rebels had
passed the Tweed, and were marching southward. The hurry
in the streets was quashed; bonfires were abandoned; and
guns, squibs, and crackers were no longer the playthings of
the uproarious crowd. Wesley proceeded on his journey,
finding watchmen standing, with great solemnity, at the end
of almost every village through which he passed. On entering
Wednesbury, after it was dark, he was bogged in a quag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>mire;
the people came with candles; and, getting out, and
leaving them to disengage his horse, he hastened to Francis
Ward’s, and, bedaubed with mire, at once commenced preaching.
On the 13th of November he arrived safe in London,
where he spent the rest of the year, in preaching, and finishing
his “Farther Appeal.” He gave away some thousands of
tracts among the common people; and his example was immediately
copied by others. The lord mayor ordered a large
quantity of papers, dissuading from cursing and swearing, to
be printed, and distributed to the trainbands; and on
December 18, “An Earnest Exhortation to Repentance” was
given at all the church doors in London, to every person who
came out, and a copy left at the house of every householder
who happened to be absent. “I doubt not,” says Wesley,
“but God gave a blessing therewith.”</p>

<p>Wesley’s old friend and brother-in-law, Westley Hall, was
already a waverer; and, at the end of 1745, wrote a long
letter, urging the two Wesleys to renounce the Church of
England. Wesley’s reply is too long for insertion here; but
it contains, besides other facts, some startling high church
principles, which are well worth noting. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We believe it would not be right for us to administer either baptism
or the Lord’s supper, unless we had a commission so to do from those
bishops whom we apprehend to be in a succession from the apostles.”</p>

<p>“We believe there is, and always was, in every Christian church
(whether dependent on the bishop of Rome or not), an outward priesthood,
ordained by Jesus Christ, and an outward sacrifice offered therein, by men
authorised to act as ambassadors of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries
of God.”</p>

<p>“We believe that the threefold order of ministers is not only authorised
by its apostolical institution, but also by the written word.”</p>
</div>

<p>We must take Wesley as we find him; but is it not surprising
to see him still tenaciously clinging, even in phraseology,
to the doctrine of apostolical succession, and the offering
of an <i>outward sacrifice</i> in the church, by an outward
priesthood? He proceeds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We allow, that many of the laws, customs, and practices of the ecclesiastical
courts are really indefensible; but we no more look upon these
filthy abuses, which adhere to our Church, as part of the building, than
we look upon any filth which may adhere to the walls of Westminster
Abbey as a part of that structure.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We will obey all the laws of that Church (such as we allow the rubrics
to be, but not the customs of the ecclesiastical courts), so far as we can
with a safe conscience; and, with the same restriction, we will obey the
bishops, as executors of those laws; but their bare will, distinct from
those laws, we do not profess to obey at all.”</p>

<p>“Field preaching is contrary to no law which we profess to obey; nor
are we clear, that the allowing lay preachers is contrary to any such law.
But if it is, this is one of the exempt cases; one wherein we cannot obey
with a safe conscience.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have here a key to much in Wesley’s remarkable
career. His doctrine of apostolical succession was a figment.
His language concerning Church of England <i>priests</i> still offering
an <i>outward sacrifice</i> savoured of the popish doctrine which
all true Protestants reject, though, as will shortly be shown,
the view he held was different from what his words express.
His belief in the “threefold order of ministers” was changed
a few weeks afterwards. Field preaching and the employment
of lay preachers had much to do with making Methodism;
and, without a continuance of these, Methodism will not maintain
its power and its position.</p>

<p>Wesley’s conference, in 1745, commenced at Bristol, on the
1st of August, and was continued for five days following. Besides
the two Wesleys, there was but one clergyman, Mr.
Hodges, present. There were six itinerants: Thomas
Richards, Samuel Larwood, Thomas Meyrick, Richard Moss,
John Slocomb, and Herbert Jenkins; and also one gentleman,
who was not a preacher at all, Marmaduke Gwynne,
afterwards the father-in-law of Wesley’s brother Charles.</p>

<p>At the opening of the conference a principle was adopted,
which ought to be practised in all similar assemblies, namely,
that every one might speak freely whatever was in his heart,
and that no one should be checked, either by word or look,
even though what he was saying was entirely wrong.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> In an
assembly of equals, met for purposes of deliberation and
counsel, free speech like this is indispensable to satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>During the first day of conference, the doctrine of justification
was reviewed; and it was agreed, that, while faith
in Christ is the sole condition of justification, repentance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
that is, conviction of sin, must go before faith, and (supposing
there be opportunity for them) fruits, or works meet for repentance,
also.</p>

<p>On the second day, the Conference discussed the doctrines
of assurance, of works done before justification, and of obedience.
It was agreed neither to discourage nor encourage
dreams, though it was admitted, that, by such means, saving
faith is often given. On the subject of sanctification, it was
laid down, that inward sanctification begins in the moment
we are justified; that, from that time, the believer gradually
dies to sin, and grows in grace; and that the seed of all sin
remains in him, till he is sanctified throughout, in spirit, soul,
and body. This entire sanctification is not ordinarily given
till a little before death; but we ought to expect it sooner;
for, though the generality of believers are not sanctified
till near death, and though few of those to whom St.
Paul wrote his epistles were so at the time he wrote, and
though he himself was not sanctified at the time of writing
his former epistles, this does not prove that we may not be
sanctified to-day. It was further agreed, that sanctification
should scarcely be preached at all to those who were not
pressing forward; and when it was, it should always be
by way of promise,—by drawing, rather than by driving.
And, further, it was determined, that the <i>general</i> means
which God has ordained for our receiving His sanctifying
grace are keeping all His commandments, denying
ourselves, and taking up our cross daily; and, that the
<i>particular</i> are prayer, searching the Scriptures, communicating,
and fasting.</p>

<p>The Methodist reader will find something here hardly in
harmony with the decisions of the previous Conference, and
with Wesley’s subsequent teaching. Twenty years after this,
in answer to the question, “What shall we do, that this work
of God may be wrought in us?” Wesley said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this, as in all other instances, ‘by grace we are saved through
faith,’ Sanctification too is ‘not of works, lest any man should boast,’
‘It is the gift of God,’ and is to be received by plain, simple faith. Suppose
you are now labouring to abstain from all appearance of evil, zealous
of good works, and walking diligently and carefully in all the ordinances
of God; there is then only one point remaining: the voice of God to
your soul is, ‘Believe, and be saved,’ First, believe that God has <i>pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>mised</i>
to save you from all sin, and to fill you with all holiness. Secondly,
believe that He is <i>able</i> thus to save to the uttermost all that come unto
God through Him. Thirdly, believe that He is <i>willing</i> as well as able.
Fourthly, believe that He is not only able, but willing to do it <i>now</i>! Not
when you come to die, not at any distant time, not to-morrow, but to-day.
He will then enable you to believe, <i>it is done</i>, according to His word; and
then ‘patience shall have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
entire, wanting nothing.’”<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At the third day’s session, the Conference debated points
of church government. The question was asked, “Is episcopal,
presbyterian, or independent church government most
agreeable to reason?” The answer given was, that each is a
development of the other. A preacher preaches, and forms
an <i>independent</i> congregation; he then forms another and
another in the immediate vicinity of the first; this obliges
him to appoint <i>deacons</i>, who look on the first pastor as their
common father; and as these congregations increase, and as
their <i>deacons</i> grow in years and grace, they need other subordinate
deacons, or helpers; in respect of whom they are
called <i>presbyters</i>, or elders; as their father in the Lord may
be called the <i>bishop</i>, or overseer of them all. To say the least,
this solution is ingenious.</p>

<p>With reference to Wesley’s assistants, fourteen in number,
it was resolved, that they had nothing to do but to save souls;
and that, in prosecuting this, they should, besides preaching
every morning and every night, spend from six o’clock till
twelve every day in reading, writing, and prayer; from twelve
to five in visiting; and from five to six in private communion
with God.</p>

<p>It was also determined what books should constitute the
libraries for Wesley’s own use, at London, Bristol, and Newcastle,—namely,
eleven on divinity; four on physic; two on
natural philosophy; one (Whiston) on astronomy; one (the
Universal) on history; two (Spenser and Milton) in poetry;
sixteen in Latin; twelve in Greek; and one (Buxtorf’s Bible)
in Hebrew.</p>

<p>While Wesley was thus conferring with his lay itinerants,
he was, unconsciously, corresponding with a man, who soon
became the highest dignitary in the Established Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span></p>

<p>Thomas Secker was six years the senior of Wesley. His
father was a Dissenter, and he himself was designed for the
Dissenting ministry. Scruples of conscience prevented this,
and young Secker resolved to qualify himself for the practice
of physic. At Leyden, he took the degree of M.D.; but, on
returning to England, in 1721, he entered himself a gentleman
commoner at Exeter College, Oxford; and, in the year following,
was ordained a deacon of the Church of England. In
1724, he became rector of the valuable living of Houghton-le-spring;
and, in 1725, married Bishop Benson’s sister. In
1733, he obtained the rectory of St. James’s; and, the year
after, was raised to the see of Bristol. In 1737, he was translated
to the diocese of Oxford; and, in 1758, was advanced
to the primacy.</p>

<p>In the month of May, 1745, this distinguished man commenced
a long, temperate, and able correspondence with
Wesley, under the <i>alias</i> of John Smith. The correspondence
was continued for nearly three years, and was first published
by Mr. Moore, in his Life of Wesley, in 1825. Space forbids
even an epitome of these able letters. They are full of
interest, intelligence, and piety; and do honour to the head
and heart of both the archbishop and the clerical itinerant.</p>

<p>The only thing which remains, before leaving the year 1745,
is to notice Wesley’s publications. His answer to Church;
his Dialogues on Antinomianism; and his Short View of the
Difference between the Moravians and himself, have been
already mentioned. The rest were partly original, and partly
abridgments from the works of others.</p>

<p>1. “Thoughts concerning the present Revival of Religion
in New England. By Jonathan Edwards. Abridged by John
Wesley.” 12mo, 124 pages. This deeply interesting work was
first published at Boston, in America, in a volume of more
than two hundred pages, and has been referred to already in
a previous chapter of the present book.</p>

<p>2. “An Extract of Mr. Richard Baxter’s Aphorisms on
Justification.” 12mo, 36 pages. The pamphlet is divided into
forty-five propositions, and, like all Baxter’s works, is full of
Scripture truth, and well worth reading.</p>

<p>3. “Hymns on the Lord’s Supper; by John and Charles
Wesley. With a preface concerning the Christian Sacrament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span>
and Sacrifice. Extracted from Dr. Brevint. By John Wesley.”
12mo, 166 pages. The hymns are a hundred and sixty-six in
number, and are distinguished by great variety of thought
and language. Several of the best are published in the
Methodist Hymn-book. An extract from Brevint, which, by
publishing, Wesley made his own, will help to explain his
meaning in the objectionable phraseology he employed in his
letter to Westley Hall.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Lord’s supper was chiefly ordained for a sacrament:—1. To <i>represent</i>
the sufferings of Christ which are <i>past</i>, whereof it is a <i>memorial</i>.
2. To <i>convey</i> the first fruits of these sufferings, in <i>present graces</i>, whereof
it is a <i>means</i>. 3. To <i>assure</i> us of <i>glory to come</i>, whereof it is an infallible
<i>pledge</i>.”</p>

<p>“The sacrifice, which by a <i>real</i> oblation was not to be offered more
than once, is, by a devout and thankful commemoration, to be offered up
every day. The <i>sacrifice</i> in itself can never be repeated. Nevertheless,
this sacrament, by our remembrance, becomes a <i>kind of sacrifice</i>, whereby
we present before God the Father that precious oblation of His Son once
offered. To <i>men</i>, the holy communion is a <i>sacred table</i>, where God’s
minister is ordered to represent, from God his Master, the passion of His
dear Son, as still fresh, and still powerful for their eternal salvation. And
to <i>God</i>, it is an <i>altar</i>, whereon men mystically present to Him the same
sacrifice, as still bleeding and sueing for mercy.”</p>
</div>

<p>The remainder of Wesley’s publications, in 1745, were
original: namely:—</p>

<p>1. “An Earnest Persuasive to keep the Sabbath holy.”
Four pages, 12mo. This was afterwards reprinted as “A
Word to a Sabbath-breaker.”</p>

<p>Sabbath breaking, in the days of Wesley, was one of the
crying sins of England. “How many are they,” he wrote, “in
every city, as well as in this, who profane the sabbath with a
high hand! How many in this, that openly defy God and
the king, that break the laws, both Divine and human, by
working at their trade, delivering their goods, receiving their
pay, or following their ordinary business, in one branch or
another, and ‘wiping their mouths and saying, I do no evil!’
How many buy and sell on the day of the Lord, even in the
open streets of this city? How many open, or (with some
modesty) half open their shops? even when they have not the
pretence of perishable goods; without any pretence at all:
money is their god, and gain their godliness. What also are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
all these droves in the skirts of the town, that well-nigh cover
the face of the earth? till they drop one after another into the
numerous receptacles prepared for them in every corner.
They drink in iniquity like water. A whole army joins
together, and, with one consent, in the face of the sun, runs
upon the thick bosses of God’s buckler.”<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>This, written in 1745, is too true a picture of the state of
things at the present day. Wesley regarded national depravity
as turning chiefly on the two hinges of sabbath profanation,
and the neglect of the education of children. Till some way
was found of stopping these great inlets of wickedness, he had
no hope of a general reformation. “The religious observance
of the sabbath,” he writes, “is the best preservative of virtue
and religion, and the neglect and profanation of it is the
greatest inlet to vice and wickedness.”<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Holding such views,
no wonder that he published the pointed, pithy tract to
which we are now adverting.</p>

<p>2. “Swear not at all, saith the Lord God of Heaven and
Earth.” Four pages, 12mo. This also was reprinted as “A
Word to a Swearer.” Like all Wesley’s tracts, it is a model
well worthy of imitation. Profane swearing was another
of the senseless, stupid, shameless sins of the period in which
Wesley lived. In another of his publications, issued in 1745,
he asks: “In what city or town, in what market or exchange,
in what street or place of public resort, is not the name of
God taken in vain, day by day? From the noble to the
peasant, who fails to call upon God in this, if in no other way?
Whither can you turn, where can you go, without hearing
some praying to God for damnation, either on his neighbour
or himself? cursing those, without either fear or remorse,
whom Christ hath bought to inherit a blessing!”<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>3. “A Word in Season; or, Advice to an Englishman.”
Twelve pages, 12mo. This was published at the beginning of
the rebellion, and shows what would be the dreadful results if
the Pretender should become king of England by conquest.
Popery would be established, and property would be confiscated.
“Who can doubt,” he asks, “but one who should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>
conquer England, by the assistance of France, would copy
after the French rules of government?” He continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How dreadful then is the condition wherein we stand! On the very
brink of utter destruction! But why are we thus? I am afraid the
answer is too plain, to every considerate man. Because of our sins;
because we have well-nigh filled up the measure of our iniquities. For
what wickedness is there under heaven, which is not found among us
at this day? Not to insist on sabbath breaking, thefts, cheating, fraud,
extortion, violence, oppression, lying, robberies, sodomies and murders,
which with a thousand unnamed villainies are common to us and our
neighbour Christians of Holland, France, and Germany,—what a plentiful
harvest we have of wickedness almost peculiar to ourselves! For who
can <i>vie with us</i> in the direction of courts of <i>justice</i>? In the management
of public <i>charities</i>? Or in the <i>accomplished</i>, barefaced wickedness,
which so abounds in our <i>prisons</i>, and <i>fleets</i>, and <i>armies</i>? Who in <i>Europe</i>
can compare with the <i>sloth</i>, <i>laziness</i>, <i>luxury</i>, and <i>effeminacy</i> of the
<i>English gentry</i>? Or with the <i>drunkenness</i>, and stupid, senseless <i>cursing</i>
and <i>swearing</i>, which are daily seen and heard in our streets? Add to all
these that open and professed <i>Deism</i> and <i>rejection</i> of the gospel,—that
<i>public</i>, <i>avowed</i> apostasy from the Christian faith, which reigns among the
rich and great, and hath spread from <i>them</i> to <i>all</i> ranks and orders of men,
and made us a people fitted for the <i>destroyer of the gentiles</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>This, under the circumstances then existing, was bold
writing; but Wesley was a bold man, and never shunned
what he conceived to be his duty because it was difficult and
dangerous.</p>

<p>4. “A Word to a Drunkard.” Four pages, 12mo. The
following are the opening sentences:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Are <i>you</i> a man? God made you a <i>man</i>; but you make yourself
a <i>beast</i>. Wherein does a <i>man</i> differ from a <i>beast</i>? Is it not chiefly
in <i>reason and understanding</i>? But you throw away what <i>reason</i> you
have. You strip yourself of your <i>understanding</i>. You do all you can to
make yourself a mere <i>beast</i>; not a fool, not a madman only; but a
<i>swine</i>, a poor filthy swine. Go and wallow with them in the mire! Go,
drink on, till thy nakedness be uncovered, and shameful spewing be on
thy glory! O how honourable is a <i>beast</i> of God’s making, compared to
one who makes himself a <i>beast</i>! But that is not all. You make yourself
a <i>devil</i>. You stir up all the devilish tempers that are in you, and gain
others which perhaps were not in you. You cause the fire of anger,
or malice, or lust to burn seven times hotter than before.”</p>
</div>

<p>5. It was also about this period, that Wesley wrote and
published his small tract (12mo, four pages), entitled, “A
Word to an Unhappy Woman.”</p>

<p>6. “Advice to the People called Methodists.” Twelve pages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
12mo. The advices are five in number:—1. To consider, with
deep and frequent attention, the peculiar circumstances in
which they stood; for their name, their principles, and their
strictness of life were <i>new</i>. They were <i>newly united</i> together,—a
poor, low, and insignificant people,—most even of their
teachers being quite unlearned men. 2. Not to imagine that
they could avoid giving offence. 3. To consider deeply with
themselves, is the God whom we serve able to deliver us?
4. To be true to their principles. 5. Not to talk much of
what they suffered.</p>

<p>7. Wesley’s last and most important publication was, “A
Farther Appeal to men of Reason and Religion.” 12mo, 106
pages.</p>

<p>First of all, he gives a summary of the doctrines he teaches.
He then proceeds to meet the objection, that justification
by faith alone is not a scriptural doctrine, nor the doctrine
of the Church of England. He next replies to the accusations
of the Bishop of London, in his pamphlet, entitled,
“Observations upon the Conduct and Behaviour of the
Methodists,” which had been sent to every clergyman in the
London diocese. Whitefield had already published an answer
to this episcopal production, in two letters, addressed “to
the right reverend the Bishop of London, and the other
right reverend the bishops concerned in the publication
thereof;” and now Wesley undertakes the same formidable
task,—David against Goliath,—an outcast priest against a
whole bench of bishops. Wesley dissects the prelate’s
pamphlet, and, with a master’s brevity, refutes it bit by bit.
He then replies to a similar production, which has been already
noticed, “The Notions of the Methodists Disproved;”
and after that proceeds to answer the “charge,” lately published
by the Lord Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, Dr.
Smalbroke, a man of some ability, but not over skilled in
logic, who, in one of his best productions, “A Vindication of
our Saviour’s Miracles,” showed his weakness by calculating
the precise number of devils in the herd of Gadarenish swine.
Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I conceive, not only, that your lordship has <i>proved</i> nothing hitherto;
but that, strictly speaking, you have not <i>attempted to prove</i> anything,
having <i>taken for granted</i> whatever came in your way. What is become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>
of your demonstration? Leave it to the carmen and porters, its just
proprietors; to the zealous apple-women, that cry after me in the street,
‘This is he that rails at the <i>Whole Dutyful</i> of man.’ But let every
one that pretends to learning or reason be ashamed to mention it any
more. O my lord, whom have you represented as rank, dreaming enthusiasts?
as either deluded or designing men? Not only Bishop Pearson,
a man hitherto accounted both sound in heart, and of good understanding;
but likewise Archbishop Cranmer, Bishop Ridley, Bishop Latimer,
Bishop Hooper; and all the venerable compilers of our liturgy and
homilies: all the members of both the houses of convocation, by whom
they were revised and approved: yea, King Edward, and all his lords
and commons together, by whose authority they were established!
And, with these <i>modern enthusiasts</i>, Origen, Chrysostom, and Athanasius
are comprehended in the same censure.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley’s object in this important treatise may be gathered
from its concluding paragraph:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have now answered most of the current objections, particularly such
as have appeared of weight to religious or reasonable men. I have endeavoured
to show, first, that the <i>doctrines</i> I teach are no other than the
great truths of the gospel. Secondly, that though I teach them not as I
<i>would</i>, but as I <i>can</i>, yet it is in a <i>manner</i> not contrary to law. And
thirdly, that the <i>effects</i> of thus preaching the gospel have not been such
as was weakly or wickedly reported,—these reports being mere artifices of
the devil, to hinder the work of God.”</p>
</div>

<p>Up to the present, most of Wesley’s publications were small
and cheap; but they had an immense circulation, and not
only paid expenses, but left a profit. In a sermon, written in
the year 1780, he naively remarks: “Two-and-forty years ago,
having a desire to furnish poor people with cheaper, shorter,
and plainer books, than any I had seen, I wrote many small
tracts, generally a penny apiece; and afterwards several
larger. Some of these had such a sale as I never thought of;
and, by this means, I unawares became rich. But I never
desired or endeavoured after it. And now that it is come
upon me unawares, I lay up no treasures upon earth; I lay
up nothing at all. I cannot help leaving my books behind
me whenever God calls me hence; but, in every other respect,
my own hands will be my executors.”<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1746<br />

Age  43</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHITEFIELD and his wife spent the whole of the
year 1746 in America. “I love,” said he, “to range
in the American woods, and sometimes think I shall never
return to England any more.”<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Writing to Wesley, in October,
he remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The regard I have always had for you and your brother, is still as great
as ever; and I trust we shall give this and future ages an example of true
Christian love abiding, notwithstanding difference in judgment. Why our
Lord has permitted us to differ as to some points of doctrine, will be discovered
at the last day. I have had the pleasure of reading the continuance
of your Appeal; and pray, that God would prosper every labour of your pen
and lip. I find that antinomianism has been springing up in many places.
I bless God, you have made a stand against it. If you ask, how it is with
me, I answer, happy in Jesus, the Lord my righteousness. If you ask, what
I am doing,—ranging and hunting in the American woods after poor
sinners. If you ask, with what success,—my labours were never more
acceptable; and the door, for fifteen hundred miles together, is quite
open for preaching the everlasting gospel. In Maryland and Virginia,
people fly to hear the word like doves to the windows. Congregations
are large, and the work is going on, just as it began and went on in
England. Notwithstanding the declining state of Georgia, the orphan
house is in a better situation than ever; and, in a year or two, I trust it
will support itself. Several of the great and rich favour the Redeemer’s
cause, and many of my professed enemies are made to be at peace with
me. O reverend and dear, and very dear sir, be pleased to continue to
pray for me, your most affectionate, though unworthy, younger brother
and servant in Jesus Christ,</p>

<p class="psig">“<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Charles Wesley spent more than four months in London
and its vicinity; about six in Bristol, in Cornwall, and in the
west of England; and the last weeks of the year in a tour to
Yorkshire and Newcastle. Like a flaming seraph, his soul
glowed with sacred love and music; and no toil, danger, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
persecution was too great to be encountered for his Saviour.
In Cornwall, it was rumoured, that he had brought the Pretender
with him; and the famous Mr. Eustick came with a
warrant to apprehend him: but, as usual, at the last moment,
Eustick’s courage failed him. At Shoreham, as soon as he
commenced the service, the wild rabble “began roaring,
stamping, blaspheming, ringing the bells, and turning the
church into a bear garden.” At Hexham, while preaching in
a cockpit, Squire Roberts did his utmost to raise a mob; and
two butlers, in the employ of two magistrates, brought their
cocks, and set them fighting. In the midst of all, Charles
was jubilant, and expressed the gratitude of his heart in the
following thanksgiving:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“All thanks be to God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Who scatters abroad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Throughout every place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the least of His servants, His savour of grace:</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Who the victory gave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">The praise let Him have,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">For the work He hath done;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All honour and glory to Jesus alone!”<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Equal zeal and heroism characterized Wesley’s helpers.
At Nottingham, the mob surrounded the meeting-house, and
threatened to pull it down. John Nelson was seized by
the constable for creating the riot, and was taken to an
alderman, the crowd following him with curses and huzzas.
The alderman asked his name, and said: “I wonder you
cannot stay at home; you see the mob won’t suffer you to
preach in Nottingham.” John replied, that he was not aware
that Nottingham was governed by a mob, most towns being
governed by the magistrates; and then proceeded “to set
life and death before him.” “Don’t preach here,” said the
alderman; while the constable began to be uneasy, and asked
how he was to dispose of his prisoner. “Take him to your
house,” quoth the alderman. The constable desired to be
excused; and, at length, was directed to conduct Nelson
back to the place from which he had brought him, and to be
careful he was not injured. “So,” says honest John, “he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span>
brought me to our brethren again; and left us to give thanks
to God for all His mercies.”</p>

<p>Wesley began the year 1746 by preaching in London at
four o’clock in the morning, a thing not often done by his
successors.</p>

<p>On January 20, he set out for Bristol, and on the road
read a book which greatly moulded his future character and
course. Lord King was the son of a grocer at Exeter, and
the nephew of the celebrated Locke, who left him half his
library. At the age of twenty-two, in 1691, he published,
“An Inquiry into the Constitution, Discipline, Unity, and
Worship of the Primitive Church, that flourished three
hundred years after Christ; faithfully collected out of the
extant writings of those ages.” King was a rigid Dissenter;
and the chief object of his learned work was to prepare the
way for that comprehension of the Dissenters within the
pale of the Established Church, which the Revolution of 1688
was supposed likely to accomplish. After this, he rose to be
Lord High Chancellor of England, and died in 1734, leaving
behind him a character of great virtue and humanity, and
of steady attachment to civil and religious liberty.</p>

<p>The above book by Lord King was Wesley’s companion on
his way to Bristol; and, after reading it, he wrote: “In
spite of the vehement prejudice of my education, I was ready
to believe that this was a fair and impartial draught; but,
if so, it would follow, that bishops and presbyters are
essentially of one order, and that, originally, every Christian
congregation was a church independent of all others.”</p>

<p>Thus, notwithstanding his strong affection for the Church
of England, we find Wesley, almost at the commencement
of his Methodist career, entertaining doubts respecting its
ecclesiastical polity. The recorded decisions of the Conference
of 1745 plainly show, that he regarded his preachers
as deacons, and presbyters, and thought himself a scriptural
bishop. Lord King’s researches served to confirm these
sentiments. In the minutes of the conference held a year
after this (1747), we find the following questions and
answers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Q.</i> Does a church in the New Testament always mean a single
congregation?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>A.</i> We believe it does. We do not recollect any instance to the
contrary.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> What instance or ground is there then in the New Testament for
a <i>national</i> church?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> We know none at all. We apprehend it to be a merely political
institution.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> Are the three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons plainly
described in the New Testament?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> We think they are; and believe they generally obtained in
the churches of the apostolic age.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> But are you assured, that God designed the same plan should
obtain in all churches, throughout all ages?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> We are not assured of this; because we do not know that it is
asserted in Holy Writ.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> If this plan were essential to a Christian church, what must
become of all the foreign reformed churches?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> It would follow, that they are no parts of the church of Christ! A
consequence full of shocking absurdity.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> In what age was the Divine right of episcopacy first asserted
in England?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> About the middle of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. Till then all the
bishops and clergy in England continually allowed, and joined in, the
ministrations of those who were not episcopally ordained.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> Must there not be numberless accidental varieties in the government
of various churches?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> There must, in the nature of things. For, as God variously
dispenses His gifts of nature, providence, and grace, both the offices
themselves and the officers in each ought to be varied from time to time.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> Why is it, that there is no determinate plan of church government
appointed in Scripture?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> Without doubt, because the wisdom of God had a regard to this
necessary variety.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> Was there any thought of uniformity in the government of all
churches, until the time of Constantine?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> It is certain there was not; and would not have been then, had
men consulted the word of God only.”<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is an important extract. Wesley loved the Church of
England; but who will say, that the views of Wesley were
now identical with those of the high church bigots of either
past or present days! Their views had been his; but he now
renounced them. Lord King, the Dissenter, had converted
him. His principles, respecting ecclesiastical polity, were
changed. After this, we have no more nonsense concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
apostolical succession. Indeed, in reference to this, Wesley
wrote (in 1761): “I never could see it proved; and I am
persuaded I never shall.”<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> It is not too much to say, that,
from the time of reading the book of Lord King, Wesley’s
principles of ecclesiastical polity were substantially the same
as those of Dissenters. He still preferred the Church of
England, not because he thought it the only church, but
because, upon the whole, he thought it the best. In the above
extract, we have the principles deliberately adopted, which
laid the groundwork of his future proceedings. As a presbyter,
in other words a bishop, he employed preachers, and
set them apart to the sacred office. It is true, that it was
not until nearly forty years after this, that he began to use
the imposition of hands; but that was a mere <i>circumstance</i>,
not the <i>essence</i> of ministerial ordination. Mr. Watson properly
observes: “It has been generally supposed, that Mr. Wesley
did not consider his appointment of preachers as an <i>ordination</i>
to the ministry; but only as an irregular employment of
laymen in the spiritual office of merely expounding the
Scriptures in a case of moral necessity. This is not correct.
They were not appointed to expound or preach merely, but
were solemnly set apart to the pastoral office; nor were they
regarded by him as <i>laymen</i>, except when in common parlance
they were distinguished from the clergy of the Church.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
His usual mode of <i>setting apart or ordaining</i> to the ministry
consisted of a most rigid examination of the ministerial
candidate on the three points—Has he grace? Has he gifts?
Has he fruit? preceded by fasting and prayer; and followed
by official and authoritative appointment to ministerial work.
For the present, the form of laying on of hands was not
employed; but it was thought of, and was discussed. Hence
the following extract from the minutes of the conference held
in 1746:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Q.</i> Why do we not use more form and solemnity in receiving a new
labourer?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> We purposely decline it—(1) Because, there is something of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span>
stateliness in it. (2) Because, we would not make haste. We desire
barely to follow Providence, as it gradually opens.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is granted that, for Wesley, after this, to fight so
tenaciously for the Church of England was inconsistent, but
we take him as we find him. Facts are facts; and we shall
not attempt to blink them. Having founded churches, or
societies as he persisted in calling them, he proceeded to
provide and to <i>ordain</i>,—yes, to <i>ordain</i> for them ministers.
He was a clergyman of the episcopal Church of England,
with the views of a Dissenter, and, acting accordingly, there
was, of course, in his future proceedings, much that was incongruous
and perplexing.</p>

<p>Wesley left London for Bristol, on January 20. Two days
afterwards, he attended, in the latter city, a conference of the
Calvinistic Methodists, at which there were present Howel
Harris and eleven of his preachers, and Wesley and four of
his. Wesley seems to have been president; at all events, his
name stands first. The following are the minutes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After prayer it was inquired:—(1) How we may remove any
hindrances of brotherly love which have occurred. (2) How we may
prevent any arising hereafter. It was feared that, in consequence of Mr.
Wesley’s preaching in Neath, there would be a separation in the society.
He answered, ‘I do not design to erect a society at Neath, or any town
in Wales, where there is a society already, but to do all that in me lieth
to prevent any such separation.’</p>

<p>“We all agreed that, if we occasionally preached among each other’s
people, we should endeavour to strengthen and not to weaken each other’s
hands, and prevent any separation in the several societies; and that
a brother from Wesley’s society should go with Harris to Plymouth and
the west, to heal the breach there made, and to insist on a spirit of love
and its fruits among the people. Agreed, that we should, on each side,
be careful to defend each other’s characters.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is beautiful, and sets an example worthy of being
emulated by the Methodist Conferences of the present day.
It was but five or six years since the Methodist schism had
happened; and yet, under the magnanimous management of
Wesley and Howel Harris, here we find the two parties met,
not to fight, but to love each other. Differences are kept up
and perpetuated, not by greatness and goodness, but by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
despicable ignorance and selfish meanness. Why should
Ephraim envy Judah, and Judah vex Ephraim? The two
are brothers; and, as brethren, it would be a goodly and
pleasant sight to see them <i>dwelling together</i> in unity.</p>

<p>Wesley spent a month in Bristol and the neighbourhood;
during which period his brother Charles opened a chapel
at Wapping;<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> and Wesley himself received the following
cautionary letter from a new clerical acquaintance, and, ever
afterwards, most confidential and trustworthy friend. Vincent
Perronet was now vicar of Shoreham, in the county of Kent.
A year and a half before, Wesley and Perronet had been
brought together by their mutual friend, the Rev. Henry
Piers. Wesley writes: “I hope to have cause of blessing
God for ever for the acquaintance begun this day.” The
hope was realised. Wesley had no more faithful friend than
Vincent Perronet, who now wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
<i>“February 7, 1746.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,—I make no apology for this trouble, because I
know that you will think it needs none. God hath raised you up to
propagate His spiritual kingdom in the hearts of men; therefore, be
careful how you frustrate this great design of God. But will you not do
this, if you injure your health? Or can you labour in the vineyard of
Christ, when your strength is gone? Deny yourself, my dear friend, so
far as is consistent with your constant labour; but be cautious lest your
self denials should rob God or His children of what you have undertaken
for the service of both. Remember, that, if you weaken your body by
over mortifications, you render yourself so far incapable of promoting the
honour of the former, and the happiness of the latter; and yet I know
that each of these is dearer to you than life itself. Let the Holy Spirit’s
advice, out of the mouth of a mortified apostle, to the abstemious
Timothy, be constantly before you.</p>

<p>“I am, with great sincerity, my dear brother in Christ, your most
affectionate</p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="smcap">Vincent Perronet</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>At this period, advice like this, in Wesley’s case, was not
unneeded.</p>

<p>On February 17, when days were short and weather far
from favourable, he set out, on horseback, from Bristol to
Newcastle, a distance of between three and four hundred
miles. The journey occupied ten weary days. Brooks were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
swollen, and, in some places, the roads were impassable,
obliging the itinerant to go round about through fields. At
Aldridge Heath, in Staffordshire, the rain turned into snow,
which the northerly wind drove against him, and by which he
was soon crusted over from head to foot. At Leeds, the mob
followed him, and pelted him with whatever came to hand.
Several of the missiles struck him, some on the face, but
none seriously hurt him. At Skircoat Green, he preached to
a congregation of Quakers; and at Keighley, found the snow
so deep, that he was obliged to abandon his intention of
travelling through the dales. He arrived at Newcastle on
February 26.</p>

<p>Here he found general sickness. Two thousand of the
soldiers, belonging to the encampment on the town moor,
were already dead, and the fever was still sweeping others
away in troops. In Newcastle and its neighbourhood, he
spent the next eighteen days, preaching, on one occasion,
at Placey, out of doors, in the midst of a “vehement storm,”
which, however, the preacher and his “congregation regarded
not.”</p>

<p>While he was here, a letter was published in the <i>London
Magazine</i>, addressed “to the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, in
relation to some false facts affirmed by him in his Farther
Appeal.” A passage was quoted in reference to the clergy
putting no difference between the holy and profane at the
sacramental table; and it was declared, that the quotation
“contains almost as many falsehoods as it does lines.” Wesley
is further accused of “gross misrepresentations and uncharitable
reflections”; of being “base, unjust, and senseless”;
of “crowding a heap of untruths into a little room”; of being
animated by “a blind and rash zeal, and glad to catch at
every pretence of making God the patron and favourer of
his cause.”</p>

<p>A production so bitterly scurrilous scarcely deserved an
answer; but, as Wesley was slightly in error, he, like an
honest man, frankly confessed it. The following is his reply,
published in the same periodical.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>June 18, 1746.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I delayed answering your letter of March 18, till I could be fully
informed of the facts in question.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I said in the Farther Appeal, page 48, ‘Who dares repel one of the
greatest men in his parish from the Lord’s table, even though he openly
deny the Lord that bought him? Mr. Stonehouse did this once; but
what was the event? The gentleman brought an action against him.
And who was able and willing to espouse his cause? He alone who took
it into His own hands; and, before the day when it should have been tried
here, caused the plaintiff to answer at a higher bar.’</p>

<p>“You (1) blame me for supposing that gentleman to be one who openly
denied the Lord that bought him; I mean, openly denied the supreme
Godhead of Christ. If he did not, I retract the charge.</p>

<p>“You say (2) that gentleman brought no action, nor commenced any
suit against Mr. Stonehouse. Upon stricter inquiry, I find he did not;
it was another gentleman, Mr. C—p—r.</p>

<p>“You (3) observe, it was not the death of the plaintiff which stopped
the action; but before it proceeded to a trial, Mr. Stonehouse thought fit
to request it as a favour, that the action might be stopped, promising not
to do the like any more. Mr. Stonehouse himself gives a different
account; but whether his or yours be the more just, is not material, since
the substance of what you observe is true, namely, ‘That it was not the
plaintiff’s death which stopped the action.’</p>

<p>“You add, ‘I would willingly hope, that you did not deliberately design
to impose upon the world.’ I did not; and do, therefore, acknowledge the
truth in as public a manner as I am able, being willing, as far as in me
lies, to make amends for whatever injury I have done.</p>

<p class="psig">
“I am, sir, yours,<br />

“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In the same month of March, another letter, of a different
complexion, was published in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>. The
writer begins by showing, that the years 48 and 88, in the
last two centuries, at least, if not longer, had been noted for
great changes and revolutions. Thus, in 1548, the Reformation
was first completely established in England; and, in 1588,
the famous pretended invincible Spanish Armada made its
futile attempt to destroy the Protestantism of Great Britain.
In 1648, King Charles was condemned to death, and the
gravest changes followed; and, in 1688, occurred the flight
of the last of the Stuart kings, and the English Revolution.</p>

<p>The writer then proceeds to ask, whether there is not
something remarkable “in the revival of the Moravians very
nearly about the same time with the rise of the Methodists in
England; and of a sect of the same kind in Scotland, by the
field preaching of Erskine and others; and of exactly the
same in Wales by the preaching of Howel Harris; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
of something of the same nature in France, where the
principal preacher concerned had been executed by the royal
will and pleasure. Is there not,” the writer continues,
“something very surprising in all these peoples’ rising about
the same time, and preaching, all of them, the same doctrines,
and yet all of them, and all their several intentions of so
doing, being previously unknown to each other?”</p>

<p>The above coincidence was more than curious, and the
author of the letter suggests, that such facts and others,
which he mentions, may be “the dawning of some important
religious change, or, at least, of something very extraordinary,
which the sacred womb of providence is big with.”</p>

<p>At the same time as the above, Wesley was engaged in an
important correspondence of another kind. Dr. Doddridge
was exactly a year older than his illustrious Methodist contemporary,
was the pastor of a Dissenting congregation at
Northampton, and the principal of an academy for the
education of candidates for the Dissenting ministry. Up
to the present, Wesley had chiefly lived within the state-church
enclosure; but now, having become a convert to the
principles of Lord King, he overstepped the enchanted circle,
and thought it no disgrace to commune and mingle with Dissenters.
Methodist preachers were multiplying. Few of them
had had the advantages of education and of reading. Their
knowledge, generally speaking, was confined to the first
principles of religion. These were the only subjects on which
they either did, or were able to converse. Of necessity, their
preaching was solely on the fundamental points of experimental
and practical religion; and hence, their unequalled
success in awakening and converting sinners. Preachers of
education and diversified knowledge would, perhaps, not have
excluded these; but they would, to a large extent, have
regaled their hearers with other truths, which, though of great
interest, were insignificant in point of importance when compared
with the few great and grand cardinal doctrines which
formed the staple of all the sermons of Wesley’s first
itinerants. The effect of this unadorned preaching of the
greatest of all verities was surprising. Under these untutored
discourses, people found themselves emerging out of thick
darkness into light, which St. Peter aptly describes as “<i>mar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span>vellous</i>.”
These were glorious results, and almost make one
wish, that among the cultivated and captivating preachers
of the present day, who can discourse most eloquently upon
any subject, from Eve’s figleaves up to Aaron’s wardrobe, or
from the architecture of Noah’s ark down to the whale that
swallowed Jonah, there were a sprinkling of men whose
preaching powers, like those of Wesley’s first helpers, were
confined to an incessant utterance, in burning though somewhat
boorish words, of the glorious old truths now-a-days too
much neglected,—Repentance toward God, and faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ, followed by the fruits of righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. If sinners are to be
converted, these are the doctrines which <i>must</i> be preached.
Other doctrines and truths may be interesting, useful, and
instructive; these are absolutely <i>saving</i> and <i>essential</i>.</p>

<p>Wesley was devoutly thankful for his uneducated but soul
saving preachers. Still, he saw that, as the Methodists
increased in knowledge, the preachers must keep pace with
them. Without this, though they might still be as successful
as ever in converting ignorant and rude sinners, they would be
in danger of being neglected and even despised by those who,
in consequence of conversion, had been greatly raised, in
both an intellectual and social sense, above their neighbours.
In short, Wesley felt convinced that his preachers must
not only preach but read; and being persuaded, as a sort of
clerical Dissenter, that good things might be found even
in Dissenting Nazareths, he wrote to the most distinguished
of all Dissenters then existing, to make inquiry. Six months
before, he had called on Doddridge and had addressed his
students; now, at Newcastle, in March, 1746, he addressed to
him a letter, the nature of which may be gathered from
Doddridge’s answer.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<i>March 15, 1746.</i><br />

</div>

<p>He next proceeds to the chief subject, practical divinity,
which he thinks “ought to employ the greatest part of the
care of every preacher,” and adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will not presume, sir, to mention to you the divines of the Established
Church; but as I may reasonably conclude, that the Puritans and
the divines of the separation are less known to you, you will pardon me,
if I mention a few of them, and of the chief pieces.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then he gives the names of Bolton, Hall, Reynolds, Sibbes,
Ward, Jackson, Owen, Goodwin, Baxter, Bates, Flavel, Taylor,
and Howe. He continues:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In recommending the writings of the Dissenters of the present age, I
would be more sparing; yet permit me to mention Evans, Wright, Watts,
Henry, Boyce, Bennett, Jennings, and Grosvenor. And here, dear sir, I
thought to have concluded my letter; but it occurs to my mind, that I have
said nothing of commentators. I have recommended to my pupils Beza,
Erasmus, Castellio, Heinsius, Patrick, Lowth, Locke, Pierce, Benson, Ainsworth,
Hammond, Grotius, Brennius, Wells, Calvin, Poole, Le Clerc, and
Cradock. I might mention several considerable writers, that illustrate
Scripture, though not direct commentators, such as Witsius, Saurin,
Mede, Hallet, Edwards, Le Crene, Wolsius, Raphelius, Vitringa, Boss,
Elsner, and Lardner. But as the critical study of Scripture is not so
much intended in your plan, perhaps you will think, I have gone a little
out of the way in mentioning so many upon this head.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I have by this time thoroughly wearied you. It only

<p>We return to Wesley. Accompanied by two of his
preachers, John Downes, and William Shepherd, he started
from Newcastle for the south, on the 17th of March. When
they had ridden between forty and fifty miles, Downes was so
ill that he was unable to proceed farther; and Wesley’s horse
was so lame, that it could scarcely walk. Wesley writes:—“By
riding thus seven miles, I was thoroughly tired, and my
head ached more than it had done for months. I then
thought, ‘cannot God heal either man or beast, by any means,
or without any?’ Immediately, my weariness and headache
ceased, and my horse’s lameness in the same instant. Nor
did he halt any more either that day or the next. I here
aver a naked fact; let every man account for it as he sees
good.”</p>

<p>Coming to Nottingham, he says: “I had long doubted what
it was which hindered the work of God here. But, upon inquiry,
the case was plain. So many of the society were either
triflers or disorderly walkers, that the blessing of God could
not rest upon them; so I made short work, cutting off all
such at a stroke, and leaving only a little handful, who, as far
as can be judged, were really in earnest to save their souls.”</p>

<p>At Wednesbury and Birmingham, the antinomian teachers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>
had laboured hard to corrupt the Methodists. One came to
Wesley at Birmingham, and the following colloquy ensued:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Wesley.</i> “Do you believe you have nothing to do with the law of God?”</p>

<p><i>Antinomian.</i> “I have not: I am not under the law; I live by faith.”</p>

<p><i>W.</i> “Have you, as living by faith, a right to everything in the world?”</p>

<p><i>A.</i> “I have: all is mine, since Christ is mine.”</p>

<p><i>W.</i> “May you then take anything you will anywhere—suppose out of
a shop, without the consent or knowledge of the owner?”</p>

<p><i>A.</i> “I may, if I want it; for it is mine: only I will not give offence.”</p>

<p><i>W.</i> “Have you also a right to all the women in the world?”</p>

<p><i>A.</i> “Yes, if they consent.”</p>

<p><i>W.</i> “And is not that a sin?”</p>

<p><i>A.</i> “Yes, to him that thinks it is a sin; but not to those whose hearts
are free.”</p>
</div>

<p>Horrible! No wonder, that Wesley wrote tracts against
antinomian teachers; and no wonder he adds, “Surely these
are the firstborn children of Satan!”</p>

<p>Wesley reached Bristol on March 27; and, eleven days
afterwards, laid “the first stone of the new house at Kingswood;”
preaching, on the occasion, from the words, “For
brass I will bring gold,” etc. (Isaiah lx. 17‒22.)</p>

<p>He then hurried up to London, where in company with his
friend, the Rev. H. Piers, he visited a man who called himself
a prophet. Wesley says: “We were with him about an hour.
But I could not at all think, that he was sent of God: 1.
Because he appeared to be full of himself, vain, heady, and
opinionated. 2. Because he spoke with extreme bitterness,
both of the king, and of all the bishops, and all the clergy.
3. Because he aimed at talking Latin, but could not.”</p>

<p>Having spent three weeks in London, Wesley, on the 4th
of May, again set out for Bristol; but on the 17th was back
to London. Here his first business was to settle the chapels
in Bristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle, upon seven trustees,
reserving only to himself and his brother, as he says, the
liberty of preaching and lodging there. This, however, was
scarcely correct, so far at least as Newcastle was concerned,
and as the following synopsis of the trust deed will show.
The seven trustees, for the Orphan House there, were Henry
Jackson, weaver, and William Mackford, corndealer, both of
Newcastle; John Nelson, mason, of Birstal; John Haughton,
weaver, of Chinley End; Thomas Richards, late of Trinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
College, Oxford; Jonathan Reeves, baker, late of Bristol;
and Henry Thornton, gentleman, of Grays Inn, London. The
trusts were:—1. That Wesley and his brother should have
the free use of the premises, and likewise any person or
persons whom they might nominate or appoint during their
lifetime. 2. That, after the death of the two Wesleys, the
trustees should monthly or oftener nominate and appoint one
or more fit person or persons to preach in the said house, in
the same manner, as near as may be, as God’s holy word was
preached at present. 3. That a school should be taught on
the said premises, consisting of forty poor children, to be
selected by Wesley and his brother during their respective
lives, and, after their death, by the trustees. 4. That when,
by any cause, the trustees were reduced to three, they should
fill up the vacancies, and make the number seven. 5. That,
during their lifetime, the two Wesleys should have the sole
appointment and removal of the masters and mistresses of
the school. 6. That every preacher or minister, appointed to
the Orphan House, should, as long as the appointment lasted,
preach in the said house every morning and every evening, as
had been usual and customary to be done.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>Southey has fallen into an error as to the settlement of
chapels. He writes:—“Whenever a chapel was built, care was
taken, that the property should be vested, not in trustees, but
in Mr. Wesley and the Conference.” This is incorrect. From
the first, the property of Methodist chapels was always vested
in trustees. It is true, that Wesley reserved to himself the
right of preaching in such chapels, and of appointing others
to preach therein; but, as Mr. Watson observes, neither he
nor the Conference had any more “property in the best
secured chapels, than in the poet laureate’s butt of sack.”
Wesley was glad to divest himself of such property, and to
put it into the hands of others. A year afterwards, he
writes: 1747, March 19—“I considered, ‘what would I do
now, if I was sure I had but two days to live?’ All outward
things are settled to my wish; the houses at Bristol, Kingswood,
and Newcastle are safe; the deeds, whereby they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
conveyed to the trustees, took place on the 5th instant; my
will is made; what have I more to do, but to commend my
soul to my merciful and faithful Creator?”</p>

<p>Having made arrangements in London for the settlement
of his chapels, Wesley turned his attention to another subject,
upon which opinions will differ. The number of members in
the London society, on the 12th of April, 1746, was 1939, and
the amount of their quarterly contributions £113 9<i>s.</i>,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> upon
an average, fourteen pence per member. Considering the
high price of money, and that nearly the whole of the London
Methodists were extremely poor, the amount subscribed was
highly creditable. Wesley, however, needed more than this,
not for himself but others, and propounded a somewhat novel
plan for raising it.</p>

<p>Tea was a costly luxury. It was first imported into England
about the year 1660, when an act of parliament was
passed, imposing a duty of eightpence on every gallon of the
infusion sold in coffee houses. In 1664, the East India Company
bought two pounds two ounces as a royal present to his
majesty King Charles II. It continued to be sold in London
for sixty shillings per pound till the year 1707; and, though
considerably cheaper in 1746, it was still a dear indulgence.
Wesley also believed its use to be injurious.</p>

<p>He tells us that, when he first went to Oxford, with an
exceeding good constitution, and being otherwise in health,
he was somewhat surprised at certain symptoms of a paralytic
disorder. His hand shook, especially after breakfast; but he
soon observed that, if for two or three days he intermitted
drinking tea, the shaking ceased. Upon inquiry, he found tea
had the same effect on others, and particularly on persons
whose nerves were weak. This led him to lessen the quantity
he took, and to drink it weaker; but still, for above six
and twenty years, he was more or less subject to the same
disorder.</p>

<p>In July, 1746, he began to observe, that abundance of the
people of London were similarly affected, some of them
having their nerves unstrung, and their bodily strength de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span>cayed.
He asked them if they were hard drinkers; they
replied, “No, indeed, we drink scarce anything but a little tea,
morning and night.” He says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I immediately remembered my own case, and easily gathered, from
many concurring circumstances, that it was the same case with them. I
considered, ‘what an advantage would it be to these poor enfeebled
people, if they would leave off what so manifestly impairs their health,
and thereby hurts their business also! If they used English herbs instead
of tea, they might, hereby, not only lessen their pain, but in some degree
their poverty. How much might be saved in so numerous a body as the
Methodists, even in this single article of expense! And how greatly is
all that can possibly be saved, in every article, wanted daily by those who
have not even food convenient for them! Some of the Methodists had
not food to sustain nature; some were destitute of necessary clothing;
and some had not where to lay their heads. The little weekly contributions
were barely sufficient to relieve the sick.’ I reflected ‘what might be
done, if ten thousand, or one thousand, or only five hundred, would save
all they could in this single instance, and put their savings into the poor-box
weekly, to feed the hungry, and to clothe the naked!’ I thought
further: ‘many tell me to my face, I can persuade this people to anything.
I will make a fair trial. If I can persuade any number, many who are
now weak or sick will be restored to health and strength; many will pay
those debts which others, perhaps equally poor, can but ill afford to lose;
many will be less straitened in their own families; many, by helping their
neighbour, will lay up for themselves treasures in heaven.’ Immediately
it struck me, ‘but example must go before precept; therefore, I must not
plead an exemption for myself, from a daily practice of twenty-seven
years: I must begin.’ I did so; the three first days my head ached, more
or less, all day long, and I was half asleep from morning to night. The
third day, my memory failed, almost entirely. In the evening, I sought
my remedy in prayer; and next morning my headache was gone, and my
memory as strong as ever. And I have found no inconvenience, but a
sensible benefit, in several respects, from that day to this. My paralytic
complaints are all gone; my hand is as steady now (1748) as it was at
fifteen; and so considerable a difference do I find in my expense, that, in
only those four families at London, Bristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle, I
save upwards of fifty pounds a year.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having set the example, Wesley recommended the same
abstinence to a few of his preachers; and, a week later, to
about a hundred of his people whom he believed to be strong
in faith; all of whom, with two or three exceptions, resolved,
by the grace of God, to make the trial without delay. In a
short time, he proposed it to the whole society. Objections
rose in abundance. Some said, “Tea is not unwholesome at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span>
all.” To these, he replied that many eminent physicians had
declared it was; and that, if frequently used by those of weak
nerves, it is no other than a slow poison. Others said, “Tea
is not unwholesome to me: why then should I leave it off?”
Wesley answered, “To give an example to those to whom it
is undeniably prejudicial, and to have the more wherewith to
feed the hungry and to clothe the naked.” Others said, “It
helps my health; nothing else will agree with me.” To such,
Wesley’s caustic reply was, “I suppose your body is much of
the same kind with that of your great grandmother; and do
you think nothing else agreed with her, or with any of her
progenitors? What poor, puling, sickly things, must all the
English then have been, till within these hundred years!
Besides, if, in fact, nothing else will agree with you,—if tea
has already weakened your stomach, and impaired your digestion
to such a degree, it has hurt you more than you are
aware. You have need to abhor it as deadly poison, and to
renounce it from this very hour.”<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>What was the result of Wesley’s attempt to form a <i>tea</i>-total
society? We can hardly tell; except that he himself
abstained from tea for the next twelve years, until Dr. Fothergill
ordered him to resume its use.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Charles Wesley began to
abstain, but how long his abstinence lasted we are not informed.
About a hundred of the London Methodists followed
the example of their leader; and, besides these, a large number
of others began to be <i>temperate</i>, and to use less than they had
previously.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>This was, to say the least, an amusing episode in Wesley’s
laborious life. All must give him credit for the best and most
benevolent intentions; and it is right to add, that, ten days
after his proposal was submitted to the London society, he
had collected among his friends thirty pounds for “a lending
stock,” and that this was soon made up to fifty, by means
of which, before the year was ended, above two hundred and
fifty destitute persons had received acceptable relief.</p>

<p>On July 20, Wesley set out for Bristol, where he spent the
next fortnight. While here he paid a visit to Oakhill, near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
Shepton Mallet, where “the good curate” hired a drunken
mob to make disturbance. As soon as Wesley began preaching,
the “drunken champions” began “screaming out a
psalm”; but Wesley says, “our singing quickly swallowed up
theirs. Soon after, their orator named a text, and preached
a sermon; his attendants meantime being busy in throwing
stones and dirt” at Wesley’s congregation.</p>

<p>On August 10, Wesley went to Wales. He preached in
Builth churchyard to nearly all the inhabitants that the town
contained. At Maesmennys, Lanzufried, and Wenvo, he
preached in the parish churches; and at Cardiff in the castle
yard. At Neath, he found twelve young men whom, he
says, he almost envied. They lived together in one house,
and gave away whatever they earned above the necessaries of
life. Most of them were predestinarians, but so little bigoted
to their opinions, that they would not suffer a predestinarian
to preach among them, unless he would avoid controversy.
Here Wesley preached in the open street, a gentleman and a
drunken fiddler doing their best to interrupt his service; but,
none joining them, they were soon ashamed, and the gentleman
slunk away on one side, and the fiddler on the other.
At Margam, he had to have a Welsh interpreter; and at
Leominster (to which he went during his tour), he began
preaching on a tombstone, on the south side of the parish
church, but was not allowed to finish. The mob “roared on
every side”; the bells were set a ringing; and then the organ
began to play amain. Wesley’s voice was drowned, and
hence he thought it advisable to remove to the corn market,
where he had a “quiet time,” and “showed what that sect is,
which is ‘everywhere spoken against.’”</p>

<p>Returning to Bristol, he started, on September 1, for Cornwall.
At St. Just, he found the liveliest society in the
county, and yet a few of the members he was “obliged to
reprove for negligence in meeting, which,” says he, “is always
the forerunner of greater evils.” At Sithney, he preached by
moonlight; and, at Gwennap, to an “immense multitude,” a
funeral sermon for Thomas Hitchins, from, “To me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain.”</p>

<p>Having spent a fortnight among the Cornish Methodists, he
set out, on the 16th of September, for London, his brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>
meeting him at Uxbridge, and becoming his escort to the
capital.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>After a week in London, he paid a visit to his friend Perronet,
preaching, on the way, at Sevenoaks, “to a large, wild
company,” one of whom cursed him bitterly. At Shoreham,
he preached twice in Perronet’s church; but says, “the congregation
seemed to understand just nothing of the matter.”
The rest of the year was spent in the metropolis.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that Wesley, for conscience sake,
was now an abstainer from tea. Before the year expired, he
went a step further. He writes: December 29—“I resumed
my vegetable diet (which I had now discontinued for several
years), and found it of use both to my soul and body; but,
after two years, a violent flux, which seized me in Ireland,
obliged me to return to the use of animal food.”</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought about the wisdom of a man, of
such active habits, adopting such an abstemious, anchorite
sort of diet, there can be no question about the fact, that his
motives were of the highest and purest kind. He gave up
tea, that he might benefit the poor; and, contemporaneously
with his resumption of a vegetable diet, he commenced an
institution, which, to say the least, was not then so popular
and so common as it is at present. He writes: “I mentioned
my design of giving physic to the poor. In three weeks
about three hundred came.” Such is the entry in his
Journal.</p>

<p>He had already provided a fund for relieving the necessities
of the poor by furnishing them with food and clothing;
but something more was requisite. Many of them were sick;
their sufferings stirred his sympathy; and yet he knew not
how to help them. “At length,” he says, “I thought of a
kind of desperate expedient: ‘I will prepare and give them
physic myself.’ For six or seven and twenty years, I had
made anatomy and physic the diversion of my leisure hours;
though I never properly studied them, unless for a few
months when I was going to America, where I imagined I
might be of some service to those who had no regular phy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>sician
among them. I applied to it again. I took into my
assistance an apothecary, and an experienced surgeon; resolving,
at the same time, not to go out of my depth, but to
leave all difficult and complicated cases to such physicians as
the patients should choose. I gave notice of this to the
society; and, in five months, medicines were occasionally
given to above five hundred persons. Several of these I
never saw before; for I did not regard whether they were
of the society or not. In that time, seventy-one of these,
regularly taking their medicines, and following the regimen
prescribed (which three in four would not do), were entirely
cured of distempers long thought to be incurable. The
whole expense of medicines, during this time, was nearly
forty pounds.”<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>This was a bold step, and exposed Wesley to animadversion.
He was not a legally qualified medical practitioner,
and there were not wanting those who were ready to brand
him as a quack. His defence was, that the poor were neglected;
that physicians were often useless; and that his
own gratuitous treatment was successful. In a letter, published
in the <i>Bath Journal</i>, in 1749, he writes: “I do not
know that any one patient yet has died under my hands.
If any person does, let him declare it, with the time and
circumstances.”<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> And, in another letter addressed to Archbishop
Secker, in 1747, four months after his dispensary was
opened, he remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For more than twenty years, I have had numberless proofs, that
regular physicians do exceeding little good. From a deep conviction of
this, I have believed it my duty, within these four months last past, to
prescribe such medicines to six or seven hundred of the poor as I knew
were proper for their several disorders. Within six weeks, nine in ten
of them, who had taken these medicines, were remarkably altered for
the better; and many were cured of disorders under which they had
laboured for ten, twenty, forty years. Now, ought I to have let one of
these poor wretches perish, because I was not a regular physician? to
have said, ‘I know what will cure you; but I am not of the college;
you must send for Dr. Mead’? Before Dr. Mead had come in his
chariot, the man might have been in his coffin. And when the doctor
was come, where was his fee? What! he cannot live upon nothing!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
So, instead of an orderly cure, the patient dies; and God requires his
blood at my hands.”<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was difficult to answer this, and Wesley was not the
man to be browbeaten from the path of duty by envious
and angry members of the healing profession. Indeed, his
success was such, that, within two months after opening
his dispensary at the Foundery in London, he instituted a
second in Bristol, and writing to his friend and patron, Mr.
Ebenezer Blackwell, says, “Our number of patients increases
in Bristol daily. We have now upwards of two hundred.
Many have already desired to return thanks, having found a
considerable change for the better already. But we are at
a great loss for medicines; several of those we should choose
being not to be had at any price in Bristol.”<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>There are only two other matters, belonging to the year
1746, which require attention; namely, Wesley’s conference,
and Wesley’s publications.</p>

<p>The conference commenced in Bristol on the 12th of May,
and lasted four days.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Four clergymen were present—the
two Wesleys, and Messrs. Hodges and Taylor. Besides
these, there were four itinerants, Messrs. Reeves, Maxfield,
Westall, and Willis; and also Thomas Glascot, of whom
we know nothing. As at former conferences, so at this,
doctrines were reviewed, and carefully guarded against error
and abuse; and, after this, points of discipline were discussed
and settled. It was agreed, that “the properest
persons to be present,” at the annual conferences, were—1.
The preachers. 2. The most earnest and most sensible
of the bandleaders living in the town where the conference
was held. 3. Any pious and judicious stranger who might
be visiting the place. It was thought, that it might be
useful to read one or more of Wesley’s tracts at each conference,
were it only to correct errors, or to explain obscurities.
Wesley’s helpers were defined to be “extraordinary messengers,
designed of God to provoke the others to jealousy.”
It was resolved, that those who believed themselves to be
called of God to preach should be strictly examined on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>
three points, Have they grace, gifts, and fruit? and that
those in whom these three marks undeniably concurred
should be allowed to have such a call. It was thought
that, at present, they were not preaching the atonement so
much as they did at first; and that the sermons which were
attended with the greatest blessing, were—“1. Such as were
most close, convincing, particular. 2. Such as had most of
Christ, the Priest, the Atonement. 3. Such as urged the
heinousness of men’s living in contempt or ignorance of
Him.” It was determined, that a sufficient call of Providence
to a new place was an invitation from some worthy
person, and a probability of doing more good by going
thither, than by staying longer where they were. New
members were to be admitted into the bands and societies
only once a quarter, their names having been previously
read at meetings of the existing members; and, at the same
time, had to be read the names of those excluded from the
society. Directions were given to guard against formality
in public singing. Efforts were to be employed to induce
the people to attend the church; and, as an example to the
Bristol Methodists, it was agreed, that the Bristol preachers
should go to St. James’s church every Wednesday and Friday.
The country was divided into seven circuits, namely—1.
London, including Brentford, Egham, Windsor, Wycombe,
and the three counties of Surrey, Kent, and Essex. 2.
Bristol, including the isle of Portland, and the counties of
Somerset, Wilts, Oxford, and Gloucester. 3. Cornwall.
4. Evesham, embracing Shrewsbury, Leominster, Hereford,
and all the places from Stroud to Wednesbury. 5. Yorkshire,
to which was to be attached the six counties of
Cheshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutlandshire,
and Lincolnshire. 6. Newcastle. 7. Wales. The
present assistants were Reeves, Bennet, Haughton, Nelson,
Wheatley, Trembath, Westall, Richards, Downes, Meyrick,
Maxfield, and Walker. And to these, perhaps, would be
added, Jones, Larwood, and Cownley. Copies of the minutes
of the conferences were to be given only to those who were
or might have been present; but they were to be read to the
stewards and leaders of bands, the Sunday and Thursday
following each conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span></p>

<p>Such is a synopsis of the proceedings of the conference of
1746.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Wesley’s almost incessant travelling and
preaching, he still found time to write. Two of his publications,
in 1746, were partly his own, but principally his
brother’s.</p>

<p>First: “Hymns for those that seek, and those that have,
Redemption in the Blood of Jesus Christ.” 12mo, 68 pages.
Twenty-eight of these hymns are inserted in the Wesleyan
Hymn-Book, and are among the finest that the book
contains. One of them, evidently written by Wesley himself,
begins with the line, “How happy is the pilgrim’s lot;”
and though two or three of the verses are not suitable
for a mixed congregation to sing, the whole is strikingly
descriptive of Wesley’s own condition and experience. He
had no wife, and no children, and had just transferred his
chapels to trustees, and, hence, could sing what many in
Methodist congregations cannot.</p>

<p>Second. The other joint publication was, “Hymns of
Petition and Thanksgiving for the Promise of the Father.”
By John and Charles Wesley. 12mo, 36 pages. These
were thirty-two in number, and were specially intended for
use at Whitsuntide. Several of the best of them are in the
Methodist Hymn-Book.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>Wesley’s other publications were the following:—</p>

<p>1. “A Word of Advice to Saints and Sinners.” 12mo,
12 pages.</p>

<p>2. “Lessons for Children. Part I.” 12mo, 76 pages; with
a vignette on the title-page of an angel on clouds, with a
scroll in one hand, and a trumpet in the other. The lessons
are fifty-four in number, and are almost entirely taken from
the five books of Moses. Prefixed is an address “to all
parents and schoolmasters,” in which Wesley says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have endeavoured in the following lessons to select the plainest and
most useful portions of Scripture; such as children may the most easily
understand, and such as it most concerns them to know. These are set
down in the same order, and generally in the same words, wherein they
are delivered by the Spirit of God. Where an expression is less easy to
be understood, I have subjoined a word or two by way of explication. I
cannot but earnestly entreat you, to take good heed, how you teach these
deep things of God. Beware of that common, but accursed way, of
making children parrots, instead of Christians. Regard not <i>how much</i>,
but to how good purpose they read. Turn each sentence every way, propose
it in every light, and question them continually on every point.”</p>
</div>

<p>3. In the month of March, the Rev. Thomas Church, vicar
of Battersea, published another two shilling pamphlet, entitled,
“Some further Remarks on Mr. Wesley’s last Journal;”<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> and,
in July,<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Wesley issued, “The Principles of a Methodist
farther explained; occasioned by the Reverend Mr. Church’s
second letter to Mr. Wesley; in a second letter to that gentleman.”
12mo, 79 pages. First of all, Wesley takes up the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span>
of the Moravians; and then explains his views of justification,
and of the faith and repentance preceding it. Next he vindicates
himself against the charge of violating the discipline
of the Church of England, and of his being an enthusiast.
He declares his belief, that, in points of importance, when the
reasons brought on each side appear to be of equal weight,
it is right to decide the question by casting lots; that there
are still such persons as demoniacs, and will be such as long as
Satan is the god of this world; and that there is nothing
either in the Old Testament or the New which teaches, that
“miracles were to be confined within the limits of the apostolic
or the Cyprianic age, or, that God hath in any way precluded
Himself from working miracles, in any kind or degree,
in any age to the end of time.” The pamphlet must be read
to be appreciated. It is <i>multum in parvo</i>.</p>

<p>In November, Wesley, for the first time, published a <i>volume</i>
of sermons, price, in sheets, half-a-crown.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The title was,
“Sermons on Several Occasions;” and the book is the first of
the <i>four volumes of sermons</i>, which, with the Notes on the New
Testament, were afterwards constituted the perpetual standard
of Methodist theology. These are so widely and so well
known that further description is unneeded. The preface,
however, deserves notice. It states that the sermons contain
the substance of what Wesley had been preaching during the
last eight years; and, that there was no point of doctrine, on
which he had been accustomed to speak in public, which was
not here, incidentally, if not professedly, laid before the
reader. Wesley adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nothing here appears in an elaborate, elegant, or oratorical dress. If
it had been my desire or design to write thus, my leisure would not
permit. But, in truth, I, at present, designed nothing less; for I now write,
as I generally speak, <i>ad populum</i>. I design plain truth for plain people;
therefore, of set purpose, I abstain from all nice and philosophical speculations;
from all perplexed and intricate reasonings; and, as far as
possible, from even the show of learning, unless in sometimes citing the
original Scripture. I have thought, I am a creature of a day. I am a
spirit come from God, and returning to God. I want to know one thing,—the
way to heaven. God Himself has condescended to teach me the
way. He hath written it down in a book. O give me that book! At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span>
any price, give me the book of God! I have it; here is knowledge
enough for me. Let me be <i>homo unius libri</i>. Here then I am, far from
the busy ways of men. I sit down alone: only God is here. In His presence,
I read His book; for this end, to find the way to heaven. Is there
a doubt concerning the meaning of what I read? I lift up my heart to the
Father of lights, and ask Him to let me know His will. I then search
after and consider parallel passages of Scripture. I meditate thereon
with all the attention and earnestness of which my mind is capable. If
any doubt still remains, I consult those who are experienced in the
things of God; and then the writings whereby, being dead, they yet speak.
And what I thus learn, that I teach.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is very beautiful. Wesley was no copyist. He owed
his theology to no class of theologians, either ancient or
modern,—Moravian or otherwise. Peter Bohler and others
might suggest truths like the grand old doctrine of salvation
by faith only; but before adopting them Wesley went to
the only pure fount of theology existing, and deduced his
creed, not from Bohler’s notions, but from the book of God.
His belief was thus founded upon a rock, and he felt it so.
He declares, that his mind is open to conviction; but, at the
same time, he was conscious that he had, not only human, but
Divine authority for what he taught. Let all divinity
students copy his example.</p>

<p>Wesley’s last publication, in 1746, was Parts II. and III. of
his “Farther Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion.” 12mo,
139 pages. In some respects, this was one of the severest
works that Wesley ever committed to the press. With terrible
power, he depicts the wickedness of the nation,—forgetfulness
of God and neglect of His holy ordinances, swearing, perjury,
sabbath breaking, drunkenness, lasciviousness, speaking evil
of dignities, and robbery. Attorneys are lashed as being, in
some instances, less honest than pickpockets; and the way in
which they whipped money out of their clients’ purses is so
described, that an unjust lawyer by whom Wesley himself had
been victimised sent him back half the amount he had extorted
from him. The guardians of public charities are
charged with sacrilege. Lying was one of the fashions of the
day; and language was swollen with compliment. Pride was
rampant; and even cobblers, in London, thought themselves
wiser than secretaries of state, and coffee house disputers abler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span>
divines than archbishops. Prisons were schools of vice, out
of which prisoners emerged fitted for any kind or degree of
villainy, perfectly brutal and devilish, thoroughly furnished for
every evil word and work. In the army, profanity was fearful.
In the navy, almost every man-of-war was a floating hell. The
clergy were not free from the taint of lewdness and drunkenness,
from covetousness and idleness, from neglecting the poor and
flattering the rich. Presbyterians, in many instances, kept a
conscience void of offence, but they had among them drunkards,
gluttons, dishonest dealers, and extortioners. Baptists
were far from being faultless. Quakers affected great sanctity
and simplicity, and yet many of their women wore gold upon
their very feet, and their men might be seen with glittering
canes and snuff-boxes, even in their solemn assemblies; their
female members were too strict to lay out a shilling in a
necklace, but not too strict to lay out fourscore guineas in a
repeating watch; in one kind of apron or handkerchief they
durst not expend twenty shillings, but in another sort would,
expend twenty pounds; they declined to touch a coloured
ribbon, but would cover themselves from head to foot in costly
silk. Papists, Jews, and infidels are castigated with equal
severity; and with them the second part of the Appeal
concludes.</p>

<p>The third Part commences with an account of the present
revival of religion, and of the brutal persecutions with which
it had been assailed. Then objections are answered. Wesley
states, that he has seven thousand persons in his societies,
whose souls he could not neglect without endangering his own
salvation. He shows the difference between other reformations
of the church, and that with which he and his contemporaries
were identified, and concludes thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The difference is wide between our case and the case of any of those
above mentioned. They <i>avowedly separated</i> from the church; we utterly
<i>disavow</i> any such design. They severely, and almost continually, inveighed
against the <i>doctrines</i> and <i>discipline</i> of the church they left; we
approve both the <i>doctrines</i> and <i>discipline</i> of our church, and inveigh only
against <i>ungodliness</i> and <i>unrighteousness</i>. They spent great part of their
time and strength in contending about externals and circumstantials; we
agree with you in both; so that having no room to spend any time in
such contentions, we have one desire of spending and being spent, in
promoting plain, <i>practical religion</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span></p>

<p>It is impossible, in a brief summary like this, to give an
adequate idea of these “Appeals,” the best defence of
Methodism extant. They are among the most elaborate of
Wesley’s productions; giving a melancholy view of the low
state of religion and of public morals, when he and his brother
Methodists entered upon their extraordinary career of
ministerial labour; and containing a triumphant vindication
of their doctrines and proceedings. They all are pervaded
with a spirit of great seriousness, and display a mind deeply
affected by the sins and follies of mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747<br />

Age  44</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR a moment, let us look at Whitefield, who spent the
year 1747 in America. Wesley had written him on
the subject of union; to which he replied on the 11th of
September, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear and reverend Sir</span>,—Not long ago I received your kind
letter, dated in February last. My heart is really for an outward, as well
as an inward union. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to bring it
about; but I cannot see how it can possibly be effected, till we all think and
speak the same things. I rejoice to hear that you and your brother are
more moderate with respect to <i>sinless perfection</i>. Time and experience, I
believe, will convince you that, attaining such a state in this life, is not
the doctrine of the everlasting gospel. As for <i>universal redemption</i>, if we
omit on each side the talking for or against reprobation, which we may
fairly do, and agree, as we already do, in giving an universal offer to all
poor sinners that will come and taste of the water of life, I think we
may manage very well. But it is difficult to determine such matters at a
distance. Some time next year, I hope to see you face to face. I hope
ere long to be delivered from my outward embarrassments. I long to
owe no man anything but love. This is a debt, reverend sir, I shall
never be able to discharge to you, or your brother. Jesus will pay you
all. For His sake, I love and honour you very much, and rejoice as
much in your success as in my own. I cannot agree with you in some
principles, but that need not hinder love. What have you done with
the Moravian Brethren? Their affairs are in confusion here. I think
their foundation is too narrow for their superstructure. I believe, in
their plan, there are many plants that our heavenly Father hath not
planted. The Lord bless what is right, and rectify what is wrong in
them, in us, and in all. O for heaven! where we shall mistake, judge,
and grieve one another no more. Continue to pray for us, and assure
yourself, that you are always remembered by, reverend and very dear sir,
your most affectionate, though unworthy younger brother and willing servant
for Christ’s sake,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>So much for Whitefield. What about his English coadjutors?
Howel Harris writes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wales is like the garden of the Lord; many are awakened, and fresh
doors are opened. All the ministers and exhorters go on heartily, and
the presence and power of the Lord are still more manifest. Hasten thy
winged motion, oh glorious day! when I shall see Paul and Barnabas,
Luther and Calvin, and all the saints, joining in one song, and not so
much as remembering that they ever differed. I have lately, at their
own request, discoursed three or four times before several gentlemen,
ladies of fashion, some magistrates, counsellors, attorneys, and doctors in
divinity, and they behaved well. I have been all round South Wales,
travelling often twenty, and sometimes thirty miles a day, and preaching
twice, besides settling and conferring with the societies everywhere. I
am about to begin a round through North Wales, where I expect to be
sent home, or at least imprisoned. For ten days, my life will be in
continual danger.”</p>
</div>

<p>Joseph Williams, of Kidderminster, relates, that he had
recently been on a preaching tour in Wales, and in Yorkshire.
At Haworth, he had taken a bed at the house of Grimshaw,
with whom he held sweet fellowship, from six o’clock at night
till two o’clock next morning. Grimshaw’s church was always
crowded, and hundreds were not able to get in at all. People
flocked to hear him from all the neighbouring towns, and as
many as a hundred strangers were accustomed, on a Sunday,
to dine at the village inn. The surrounding clergy were
caballing to get him suspended; and, if they succeeded, he
was resolved to become at once an itinerant preacher. The
landlord, at Colne, told Williams that Grimshaw had
preached in that town “damnation beyond all sense and
reason,” his sermon lasting two long hours; and that, “every
week, and almost every day, he preached in barns and private
houses, and was a great encourager of conventicles.”</p>

<p>Thomas Adams says, he had been preaching in a barn at
Gosport, and that in the neighbourhood of Portsmouth the
good work was prospering. In Wilts, he had seen religion
reviving. In Gloucestershire, his labours had been blessed,
and the meetings of the societies had been a pentecost.
When at Bristol there had been “a brave shaking among the
dry bones.”</p>

<p>James Relly (who afterwards founded a sect called
“Rellyan Universalists,”) observes, that at Bristol he had
examined the whole society once a week, but the place had
been “a furnace” to him. At Bath, he had “particular freedom.”
In Gloucestershire, he had been preaching every day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span>
and thrice on Sundays; and had found the people “honest,
simple, and hungering after the bread of life.” At Wednesbury,
he found his heart enlarged every time he preached. At
Birmingham, he had formed a society of twenty members,
and had left them with great regret. At Bromsgrove, he had
preached in an Independent chapel, to a congregation of
“simple, loving souls.” At Tewkesbury, a furious mob assaulted
him, swore, cursed, laughed, pricked the congregation
with pins, threw handfuls of snuff among them, and brickbats
and dirt; and broke the windows of the house; but, in the
midst of all, he continued preaching for an hour.</p>

<p>John Relly was witnessing “many inroads made in Satan’s
kingdom,” and he seldom preached without seeing conversions.</p>

<p>Herbert Jenkins had been preaching in Scotland, and conversing
with the clergy, many of whom he pronounces to be
“good men, and very powerful preachers.” In Edinburgh, he
had found nearly twenty societies, including one composed of
soldiers, who had fought at the battle of Culloden. In the
park, he had had a congregation of many thousands. “At
Glasgow,” says the <i>Scots Magazine</i>, “he was complimented
with the freedom of the city, and was entertained by
the magistrates and by the presbytery. He made no public
collections as Whitefield did, and his behaviour altogether
was inoffensive and becoming.”</p>

<p>John Edwards had made a tour through the midland
counties, where “King Jesus was getting Himself the victory.”
He writes:—“Oh what times and seasons we have had; souls
fired with the love of God, and following the word from place
to place, horse and foot, like men engaged in a war, determined
to take the city by force of arms.” At Haverfordwest
and in Wales, multitudes flocked to hear him.</p>

<p>Certain members of the Tabernacle society, in London,
relate that the place was generally full; and a gentleman at
Plymouth writes, that “the work goes on very comfortably
there.”<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>These hints will suggest to the reader an idea of the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>
that was being done by the preachers who propagated Whitefield’s
doctrines. All the letters, filling more than a hundred
pages of the “Christian History,” breathe the most ardent
piety, and are full of gratitude, hope, and exultation.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley spent the first two months of 1747 in a
journey from Newcastle to Bristol. The next six months he
made London and Bristol the centre of his operations. The
last four months of the year were employed in Ireland.</p>

<p>Wesley himself was travelling almost incessantly, and we
must now try to follow him.</p>

<p>On January 11 he left London for Bristol. Reaching
Devizes, he found the town in the greatest uproar. Swelling
words, oaths, curses, and threatenings were abundant.
Mr. Innys, the curate, who knew of Wesley’s coming, had
spent the day in visiting from house to house, to stir up the
people against him. He had also published an advertisement,
in the most public places in the town, of “An obnubilative,
pantomime entertainment, to be exhibited at Mr.
Clark’s,” in whose house Wesley had to preach. For the
present, however, the high purpose of the zealous curate was
not realised. At the appointed hour, Wesley commenced
preaching. The well instigated mob were listeners, but they
were all dumb dogs, and attention sat on every face.</p>

<p>Sixteen days afterwards, Wesley returned to this clerical
preserve, where he again found, that great efforts had been
used to raise a rabble, but, he writes, “it was lost labour; all
that could be mustered were a few straggling soldiers, and
forty or fifty boys.”</p>

<p>Wesley told his brother, “there was no such thing as raising
a mob at Devizes”; but Charles soon found it to be otherwise.
Coming within a month after, on February 24, a crowd
awaited him, headed by “the chief gentleman of the town,”
while Mr. Innys, the energetic curate, stood with them in the
street, jumping for very joy. The reverend persecutor had
been more successful in organising ruffians to do his dirty
work, in the case of Charles, than he had been in the case of
Wesley himself. He had declared in the pulpit, as well as
from house to house, that he had heard Charles preach blasphemy
before the university, and tell his congregation, “If
you don’t receive the Holy Ghost while I breathe upon you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span>
you will all be damned.” He had secured the services of two
of the chief men in the borough, Messrs. Sutton and Willy,
both of them Dissenters. The poor parson was so supremely
happy, that he began to dance. The church bells were rung
backwards. Mrs. Philip’s house was ransacked; the windows
were smashed, and the shutters of the shop torn down; the
door was blocked up with a wagon; and lights were kindled to
prevent the preacher’s escaping. The mob then proceeded to
the inn, and seized the horses of Charles Wesley and his friend
Meriton, and, some hours afterwards, the poor animals were
found in a pond, up to the neck in water. A water engine
was played into the house where Charles was staying; the
rooms were flooded; and the goods were spoiled. The leader
of the small society was thrown into a pool, and, almost
miraculously, escaped an untimely death. The son of the
mayor had been converted, and, instead of running away to
sea, had joined the society. His father was a coward, and
had left the town, when he ought to have remained in it; but
his mother sent her maid, begging Charles Wesley to disguise
himself in a woman’s clothes, and endeavour to escape. At
length, the constable came, beseeching him to leave the town;
and poor Mr. Sutton and Mr. Willy began to fear the mob,
which they and their clerical friend Innys had been the means
of raising, was becoming more violent than might be safe.
In the midst of this, Charles Wesley and Mr. Meriton took
the opportunity to get away; and, after escaping a most
murderous attack from a couple of bulldogs, not less savage
than the bloodthirsty villains which hounded them on, the
two martyr like ministers began singing the hymn commencing,
“Worship, and thanks, and blessing;” and thus, in a
tone of triumph, made their way to Bath and Bristol.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>Strangely enough, Wesley was accustomed to choose the
worst season of the year for his most trying journey. Why?
We cannot tell. Having finished his visitation of the London
classes, he set out, on the 16th of February, for Newcastle.
A north wind blew so hard and keen, that, when he and his
companions got to Hatfield, they could scarcely use either
their hands or feet. In making their way to Baldock, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span>
encountered a storm of snow and hail, which drove so vehemently
in their faces, that sight was useless, and breathing
almost impossible. Next day, they had the greatest difficulty
in keeping their horses on their feet. The wind rose higher
and higher, till it threatened to overturn both man and beast.
A storm of rain and hail drove through their coats, great and
small, boots, and everything; and, freezing as it fell, their eyebrows
were hung with icicles. On Stamford Heath, the snow
was lying in mountain drifts, which sometimes well-nigh
swallowed up both horses and riders; but, about sunset, they
came, cold and weary, to Brigg-Casterton. On the 18th,
they were told, so much snow had fallen in the night, that
travelling was impracticable. Wesley replied, “At least, we
can walk twenty miles a day, with our horses in our hands”;
and off he set. The north-east wind was piercing; the main
road was impassable; Wesley was distracted with the toothache;
but, at five in the afternoon, they arrived at Newark.
Next day, they came to Epworth, where they rested the three
days following; with the exception, that, on Sunday Wesley
preached twice in the humble meeting-house, and once, after
the evening prayers, at Epworth cross, to most of the adult
population of the town.</p>

<p>The next three days were spent in an excursion to Grimsby
and back again to Epworth. Charles Wesley had been at
the former town seven weeks before, when the meeting-house
was invaded by a mob of wild creatures, almost naked, who
ran about the place, attacking all they met. Several caught
at the preacher to drag him down, and one struck at him.
At length, they fell to fighting and beating each other, till,
in a few minutes, they literally drove themselves out of
the very room from which they meant to drive the poor
Methodists; and one of the ringleaders, armed with a great
club, swore he would conduct the minister to his lodgings,
and forthwith led him through the drunken rioters to brother
Blow’s.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>On this occasion, when Wesley himself came, “a young
gentleman and his companions” drowned Wesley’s voice, till
a poor woman took up the cause, and, by keenly and wittily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span>
reciting a few passages of the young spark’s life, turned the
laugh of his companions upon him, and obliged him to
skulk away discomfited. Next day, he came to ask Wesley’s
pardon, and thus, for some years, Methodist persecution
at Grimsby ceased. At Tetney, Wesley found the most
remarkable society in England, with Micah Elmoor for its
leader. The members were all poor, and yet each gave from
eightpence to two shillings weekly,—certainly a large amount,
considering the rate of agricultural wages and the worth of
money. The members of the London society were not
averaging more than about a penny per week. Wesley was
surprised at the difference, and asked, “How is this?” To
which Micah Elmoor replied, “All of us, who are single
persons, have agreed together, to give both ourselves and all
we have to God; and, by this means, we are able, from time
to time, to entertain all the strangers that come to Tetney;
who often have no food to eat, nor any friend to give them
lodging.”</p>

<p>On February 26, Wesley left Epworth, and proceeded
northwards, preaching, on his way, at Sykehouse, Acomb,
Thirsk, and Osmotherley. At the last mentioned place,
where he had already found a friend in the popish priest, the
clergyman of the parish allowed him to preach twice in the
parish church. “The bitterest gainsayers,” says Wesley,
“seemed now to be melted into love. All were convinced we
are no papists. How wisely does God order all things in
their season!”</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March, he reached Newcastle. At this
period, Grace Murray had charge of the Orphan House family.
More than once, she had been an inmate; but she and sister
Jackson, like rival queens in the same establishment, were
unable to agree, and, at least twice, Wesley had had the
unenviable task of reconciling two gossiping women, whose
religion made them proud and garrulous, rather than of “a
meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price.” Grace’s first husband was drowned in 1742, upon
which she removed from London to Newcastle, where she was
appointed leader of several classes. Within six months of
her husband’s death, she became the sweetheart of John
Brydon, and it was commonly supposed they were about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>
marry, but, in the long run, Grace declined the honour of
John’s alliance. At the end of 1745, she was made Orphan
House keeper, and retained the office at the time of Wesley’s
visit, in 1747.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Unfortunately, we shall have to recur to sister
Murray at a subsequent period.</p>

<p>Another inmate was Jeannie Keith, belonging to a respectable
family of the Keiths in Scotland. Being persecuted on
account of her religious principles, she fled to England, and
took shelter in Wesley’s Orphan House, where she went by
the cognomen of “Holy Mary.” She was afterwards married
to James Bowmaker, a master builder at Alnwick, who erected
the first Methodist chapel in that town, and was the grandfather
of the Rev. James Everett. She had two children, and
died about the year 1752. It has generally been supposed, that
Jeannie Keith fell from grace, this opinion being founded upon
an expression in one of Wesley’s letters, written a year or two
previous to her death;<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> but the inference is hardly legitimate,
and the thing itself is incorrect. The writer is possessed of
authentic manuscripts, showing, that though Jeannie returned
to the presbyterian religion, she continued faithful to her
great Master to the very last. A year only before her death,
she was diligently distributing the works of John and Charles
Wesley among her friends and relatives, including Lord and
Lady Saltoun; and the greatest crime that I can find alleged
against her, is that of rejoining the church of her childhood.
An extract from one of Jeannie’s letters to Wesley, in 1747,
may be useful.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I bless God, that ever He brought me into this house. It is like a
little heaven to me. There is not only such love, but such freedom
among us, as I could not have believed would have been so soon. I
have never seen a thing, that I thought amiss in any of the family,
neither do they seem to think anything wrong in me. I am as much
entangled with the great ones of the world as ever; and if they are not
with me, I am with them. I have great reasonings, whether to shake off
all acquaintance with them or not. I am surprised how they bear the
plainness of speech that I use; for with tears do I tell them the danger
that their souls are in. Oh! forget not your weak child,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span></p>

<p>In another letter, dated November 1, 1748, and addressed
to Wesley, she writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think we never had a more blessed time in this house, since it was a
house. I know of nothing amiss betwixt sister Murray and me; but we
cannot be as one soul; for, you know, she must have a little pre-eminence.
I am exceeding willing that she should; and so we live in great peace,
and, I believe, in love. I am still unwilling to take anything from anybody.
I work out of choice, having never yet learned how long a woman
can be idle and innocent. I do not murmur because I have not worldly
goods, or a little skin-deep beauty; but I am happy, because, as long as
God lives, I shall enjoy Him; so long as there is a heaven, I shall possess
it. If this thought cannot make me happy, without anything else, I
deserve to be miserable.</p>

</div>

<p>How many more refugee sisters there were in the Orphan
House, we are not informed; but we learn from the manuscript
already quoted, that, about this period, Christopher Hopper,
Benjamin Wheatley, Edward Dunstan, and Eleazer Webster,
all of them either already or about to become itinerants, were,
more or less, Orphan House residents; and it is probable,
that these were some of the young men referred to in the
extracts following. The Orphan House was, at once, a place
of worship, a school for orphans, a refuge for the injured and
oppressed, the northern home of Wesley, and the “theological
institution” of his preachers. Wesley writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“March 2.—I rode to Newcastle. I found all in the house of the same
spirit; pouring out their souls to God many times in a day together, and
breathing nothing but love and brotherly kindness.”</p>

<p>“March 4.—This week I read over, with some young men, a compendium
of rhetoric, and a system of ethics. I see not, why a man of tolerable
understanding may not learn in six months more of solid philosophy
than is commonly learned at Oxford in four (perhaps seven) years.”</p>
</div>

<p>The old Orphan House was thus the first institution in
which young Methodist preachers received instructions for the
efficient discharge of their ministerial duties. Here Wesley
himself studied. During this very visit, he read “The Exhortations
of Ephraem Syrus,” whose picture of a broken and
contrite heart had never been excelled since the days of
David,—and “The History of the Puritans;” after which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>
wrote:—“I stand in amaze: first, at the execrable spirit of persecution
which drove those venerable men out of the Church,
and with which Queen Elizabeth’s clergy were as deeply
tinctured as ever Queen Mary’s were; secondly, at the weakness
of those holy confessors, many of whom spent so much
of their time and strength in disputing about surplices and
hoods, or kneeling at the Lord’s supper.”</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that, though only little more than four
years had elapsed since the society at Newcastle was founded
by Charles Wesley, it was now reduced from above eight
hundred members to four hundred. Wesley, however, considered,
according to the old proverb, that “the half was more
than the whole”; but if this were true, the whole must have
been a motley mass.</p>

<p>Having spent seven weeks at Newcastle and in the neighbourhood,
Wesley set out, on Easter Monday, April 20, for
London. In the evening, he reached Osmotherley, where,
after having ridden, at least, sixty miles, and preached twice,
he mounted a tombstone, and concluded the day by a
sermon from “The Lord is risen indeed.” Here John Nelson
met him, having just escaped from the hands of his murderous
persecutors in the vicinity of York.</p>

<p>Proceeding to Thirsk, Wesley found the town full of
holiday folks, drinking, cursing, swearing, and cockfighting.
Making his way to Leeds and other towns in the west riding
of Yorkshire, he visited the Moravian settlement at Fulneck,
which was now approaching completion. “It stands,” says
he, “on the side of a hill, commanding all the vale beneath,
and the opposite hill. The front is exceeding grand, though
plain, being faced with fine, smooth, white stone. The
Germans suppose it will cost about three thousand pounds; it
is well if it be not nearer ten. But that is no concern to the
English Brethren; for they are told, and believe, that all the
money will come from beyond the sea.” We shall find, in a
subsequent chapter, that Wesley’s doubts respecting the
“ways and means” were not unfounded.</p>

<p>At Keighley, Wesley ascertained that the small society of
ten had increased tenfold. He visited Grimshaw, and preached
in Haworth church. At Halifax, he addressed “a civil, senseless
congregation,” and baptized a Quaker. Meeting with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
William Darney, who, besides converting Grimshaw, had been
the means of forming a number of societies among the mountains
of Lancashire and Yorkshire, Wesley, at his request,
set out to visit those infant churches, at Roughlee, Widdap,
Stonesey Gate, and other places. While preaching one morning
at five o’clock, near New Church, in Rossendale, one of
his hearers was a young man, then in his twentieth year, who
afterwards rose to a high position,—John Butterworth, for
more than fifty years the pastor of a Baptist church, the
author of a valuable concordance to the Holy Scriptures, and
the father of the late Joseph Butterworth, Esq., who was long
a distinguished Methodist in the metropolis, and a member of
the House of Commons.</p>

<p>From Rossendale, Wesley proceeded to Manchester, where,
on the 7th of May, he preached at Salford cross. Within the
last few months, a few young men had formed themselves
into a society, had rented a room, and written a letter desiring
the Wesleys to own them as brethren. The “room” was a
small apartment in a house built upon a rock on the bank of
the Irwell, on the north side of Blackfriars Bridge, at the
bottom of a large yard, known by the name of the “Rose
and Crown yard,” and which was filled with wood built,
thatched cottages. The house, containing the “preaching
room” was three storeys high. The ground floor was a
joiner’s shop; the rooms in the middle story were the residence
of a newly married couple; the garret was the “room,”
and was itself also the home of a poor woman, who there
plied her spinning wheel, while her husband, in the same
apartment, flung the shuttle. Christopher Hopper, at one of
the Manchester conferences, referred to this little meeting-house,
and said: “In 1749, I preached in an old garret, that
overhung the river, in the neighbourhood of the old bridge.
The coals were in one corner of the room, the looms in
another, and I was in danger of breaking my neck in getting
up to it. The congregation consisted of not more than from
twenty to thirty persons.”<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Such was the cradle of Manchester
Methodism, in 1747. Wesley says, “their house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>
would not contain a tenth part of the people,”—and hence he
went to Salford cross.</p>

<p>While at Manchester, Wesley made his first visit to Boothbank.
Here resided John and Alice Crosse. Alice had
been a rude, uncultivated creature, but had a dash of the
heroine in her constitution. “John Crosse,” said she, “wilt
thou go to heaven with me? If not, I am determined not to
go to hell with thee.” Her decision was firm and final, and
honest John soon joined her in her journey to the better land.
They now gladly received the servants of God into their
dwelling, a pulpit was fixed in their largest room, a society
was formed, and Alice was made leader. Her endeavours to
be useful were indefatigable. Common beggars were intercepted,
warned of their sin and danger, prayed with, and then
relieved. Gentlemen, who came a-hunting, were run after,
and told, in the plainest terms, the consequences of their
sinful doings. On her husband being made a constable, (she
having far more courage than himself) he would send her to
the constables’ meetings, to defend the despised and persecuted
Methodists. When disappointed of a preacher, Alice
herself would occupy the pulpit, and, with faithful energy,
declare the truth as it is in Jesus. Though marked with
rusticity, she was, in decision and majesty, a Deborah.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> “She
was,” says John Pawson, “one of the most zealous, active,
spiritually minded women I ever knew.” She died in 1774,
aged sixty-five. Her house, for generations, was the happy
home of Methodist itinerants. Up to a few years ago, a
bootjack, made by John Nelson, at one of his visits, was
carefully preserved by her descendants living in the same
farm dwelling; and on the panes of glass in the window of
what was known as “the prophet’s chamber,” were not a few
inscriptions written by the brave hearted evangelists, who
there found a warm welcome. Boothbank was the loving
centre where the first Methodists of Lancashire and Cheshire
used to meet, for friendly counsel, and the old farmhouse was
licensed for preaching before any Methodist chapel was built
in Manchester. Five years after this first visit by Wesley, the
first Cheshire quarterly meeting was held in the humble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span>
dwelling of John and Alice Crosse, when Chester sent, by
Jonathan Pritchard, the sum of twelve shillings; Bolton, by
George Eskrick, eight shillings and twopence; Manchester,
by Richard Barlow, two pounds three shillings and fivepence;
while Boothbank itself contributed the not insignificant sum
of ten shillings and elevenpence.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Wesley’s description of
the Boothbank congregation, at his first visit, is brief but
beautiful,—“a quiet and loving people.”</p>

<p>Leaving Boothbank, he proceeded to Mr. Anderton’s, near
Northwich. Here he preached, prayed, and talked for more
than two hours, his rustic congregation being intermixed with
“several of the gay and rich.” Many long years elapsed, however,
before Methodist preaching was established in the town
itself, and here, as elsewhere, Methodism met with brutal
persecution. On one occasion, the preacher was pulled down
the street by the hair of his head.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> On another, John Morris
narrowly escaped being thrown over the bridge into the river.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
The mob, encouraged by two young gents of the names of
Barrow and Jeffreys, rejoiced not only in throwing stones,
mud, and rotten eggs, but in dragging the Methodist itinerants
into a quagmire, which divided the townships of Northwich
and Witton. One of the first Methodists here was Isaac
Barnes, a seedsman, who was often rolled in the foul river,
and in other respects made to suffer; but his sister once
used a device by which the biters were bitten. While the
mob were shouting, swearing, and throwing stones at the
front of her brother’s house, she quietly heated the poker,
and then, letting it cool till its redness was removed, she
rushed into the street, and pretended to strike the assembled
scamps. One seized the poker, but instantly let it go.
Others, in quick succession, did the same; and, in a little
while, the amazon was victorious; by their own act, in seizing
the heated poker, most of the assailants were in burning
agony; and the valorous mob were surprised and scattered.
Moses Dale was another of the first Northwich Methodists,—a
poor and plain, but earnest and honest man,—a class-leader
and local preacher, who was once carried round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
town on a butcher’s block, and then set down in the market
place, where the crowd with cow horns blew into his ears
till he was almost deafened. Moses was a man of small
ability, but a son of thunder. Once a year, he made a
preaching tour through Derbyshire and Shropshire, and, on
one occasion, preached in the vicarage at Madeley, with his
hands on Fletcher’s shoulders. “Moses,” said some young
swells in a chemist’s shop, “is it true that you know your sins
forgiven?” “I am forbidden to tell you,” quietly replied
Moses. “Who forbids you, Moses?” “Jesus Christ,” said
Moses; “look at Matthew vii. 6.” “Surely, Moses, you don’t
compare us to swine?” “No,” quoth Moses, “but the Bible
does, and I have no occasion.” Poor Moses died in 1788.</p>

<p>From Northwich, Wesley went to Congleton, and Macclesfield,
and Sheffield, and Leeds; and then, turning round, he
hurried, by way of Nottingham and Birmingham, to London,
which he reached on the 21st of May.</p>

<p>For the last eight years, Wesley had been shut out of the
London churches; but now, to one of them, he was again
admitted. The Rev. Richard Thomas Bateman, a man of
high birth and great natural endowments, was rector of St.
Bartholomew’s the Great, in Smithfield, and also held a living
in Wales, where he had been converted under the powerful
ministry of the Rev. Howel Davies.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Being converted himself,
he, at once, with great fervour, began to pray and preach
for the conversion of others.</p>

<p>As soon as Wesley got back to London, Mr. Bateman
offered him his pulpit, and the offer was accepted. The
church was crowded to excess. The churchwardens complained
to Bishop Gibson, saying, “My lord, Mr. Bateman,
our rector, invites Mr. Wesley very frequently to preach in
his church.” The bishop replied, “What would you have
me do? I have no right to hinder him. Mr. Wesley is a
clergyman, regularly ordained, and under no ecclesiastical
censure;”<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> and so the matter ended.</p>

<p>From the first, the financial affairs of the London society
had been entrusted to stewards. Hitherto, they had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span>
sixteen in number, but Wesley now reduced them to seven,
to whom he gave a series of instructions how to regulate their
behaviour. They were to hold meetings every Tuesday and
Thursday morning. Every meeting was to begin and end
with prayer. Once a month, their accounts were to be transcribed
into the ledger. Each, in turn, was to be chairman for
a month. Nothing was to be done without the consent of the
minister. They were to be deeply serious. Only one was to
speak at once, and he only just loud enough to make himself
heard. They were to avoid all clamour and contention. If
they could not relieve the poor who came, they were not to
grieve them. They were to give them soft words, if nothing
else; and to make them glad to come, even though they had
to go away empty. A steward breaking any of these rules,
after being thrice admonished by the chairman, was to be
deposed from office.</p>

<p>It may be asked whence the stewards obtained their funds.
The answer is, that, for more than forty years, all the money
collected in the London classes was put into the hands of
these officials, and was distributed in relieving the necessities
of the poor. Not a shilling seems to have been spent upon
the preachers’ salaries.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>Visiting the sick, and the opening of the dispensary, have
been already noticed. But, besides these, there were connected
with the old Foundery other expensive and valuable
institutions. Two small houses were taken and fitted up for
the reception of needy and deserving widows, for the support
of whom the collections at the sacraments and the contributions
of the bands were given. In 1748, Wesley writes: “In
this (commonly called the poor-house) we have now nine
widows, one blind woman, two poor children, and two upper
servants, a maid and a man. I might add, four or five
preachers; for I myself, as well as the other preachers who
are in town, diet with the poor, on the same food, and at the
same table; and we rejoice herein, as a comfortable earnest of
our eating bread together in our Father’s kingdom.”<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>Then there was a school with two masters, and about sixty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>
children, a few of whom paid for their tuition, but the greater
part, being extremely poor, were taught and even clothed
gratuitously. The rules were characteristic, but some of them
exceedingly absurd. No child was to be admitted under the
age of six. All the children were to be present every morning
at the five o’clock preaching. The school hours were from six
to twelve, and from one to five. No holidays were granted.
No child was to speak in school, but to the masters; and any
child who was absent two days in one week, without leave,
was to be excluded. The education consisted of reading,
writing, and arithmetic. Two stewards were appointed to
receive subscriptions and to pay expenses; and also to pray
with and exhort the children twice a week; and to meet the
parents every Wednesday morning, and give them counsels
how to train their children when at home.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>Then there was a lending society. Observing that people
often needed small sums of money, but knew not where to
borrow them, Wesley went from one end of London to the
other, and, in a few days, begged £50. This was lodged in
the hands of stewards, who attended every Tuesday morning
for the purpose of lending to those who wanted any small
amount, not exceeding twenty shillings, on condition that the
loan should be repaid within three months. Wesley writes:
“It is almost incredible, but, with this inconsiderable sum, two
hundred and fifty have been assisted within the year 1747.
Will not God put it into the heart of some lover of mankind
to increase this little stock? If this is not lending unto the
Lord, what is?”<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>The stock was increased. At the commencement of 1748,
Wesley made a public collection for the same object, and by
this and by other means the capital was raised, in 1767, to
£120,<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> after which the maximum loan was altered from one
pound to five.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Hundreds of the honest poor were greatly
assisted by this benevolent device; and, among others, the well
known Lackington, who about the year 1774 was penniless,
but who, by the help of Wesley’s fund, began a book business,
which grew to such immense dimensions, that, eighteen years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span>
afterwards, its annual sales were more than a hundred thousand
volumes, from which Lackington, the quondam cobbler, realised
the noble income of £5000 a year.</p>

<p>Such were the benevolent institutions connected with the
Foundery in 1747. Wesley was often accused of making
himself rich. In reply to this, in 1748, he sarcastically remarks:—“Some
have supposed my revenue was no greater
than that of the Bishop of London. Others have computed,
that I receive £800 a year from Yorkshire only. If so, it
cannot be so little as £10,000 a year which I receive out of all
England! Accordingly, the rector of Redruth extends the
calculation pretty considerably. ‘Let me see,’ said he; ‘two
millions of Methodists, and each of these paying twopence
a week.’ If so, I must have £860,000, with some odd
shillings and pence, a year! A tolerable competence! But
be it more or less, it is nothing at all to me. All that is
contributed or collected, in every place, is both received and
expended by others; nor have I so much as the ‘beholding
thereof with my eyes.’ And so it will be, till I turn Turk or
pagan. For I look upon all this revenue, be it what it may,
as sacred to God and the poor; out of which, if I want anything,
I am relieved, even as another poor man. So were
originally all ecclesiastical revenues, as every man of learning
knows; and the bishops and priests used them only as such.
If any use them otherwise now, God help them!”<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>The conference of 1747 began on the 15th of June, and
ended on the 20th. This was the largest yet held. Six
clergymen were present, namely, John and Charles Wesley,
Charles Manning, Richard Thomas Bateman, Henry Piers,
and Vincent Perronet; also Howel Harris; and nine preachers,
John Jones, Thomas Maxfield, Jonathan Reeves, John Nelson,
John Bennet, John Downes, Robert Swindells, John Maddern,
and Thomas Crouch, the last mentioned being a local preacher
only.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>Two doctrines were discussed at the conference of 1747;
first, whether a Divine assurance of the forgiveness of sins is
an essential part of justifying faith; and secondly, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span>
entire sanctification is attainable in the present life. It was
inquired, “Is justifying faith a Divine assurance that Christ
loved <i>me</i>, and gave Himself for <i>me</i>?” Answer: “We believe
it is.”<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> This was unguarded language, and John Wesley soon
felt it so. A month later, he seems to have examined the
subject more closely, and wrote to his brother Charles as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yesterday I was thinking on a <i>desideratum</i> among us, a <i>genesis problematica</i>
on justifying faith. A skeleton of it, I have roughly set down.</p>

<p>“Is justifying faith a sense of pardon? <i>Negatur.</i></p>

<p>“By justifying faith, I mean, that faith, which whosoever hath not is
under the wrath and curse of God. By a sense of pardon, I mean, a distinct,
explicit assurance, that my sins are forgiven.</p>

<p>“I allow (1) That there is such an explicit assurance. (2) That it is the
common privilege of real Christians. (3) That it is the proper Christian
faith, which purifies the heart, and overcomes the world.</p>

<p>“But I cannot allow, that justifying faith is such an assurance, or
necessarily connected therewith.</p>

<p>“Because, if justifying faith necessarily implies such an explicit assurance
of pardon, then every one who has it not, and every one so long as
he has it not, is under the wrath and curse of God. But this is a supposition
contrary to Scripture and to experience (Isa. l. 10, and Acts x. 34).</p>

<p>“Again, the assertion, that justifying faith is a sense of pardon, is contrary
to reason; it is flatly absurd. For how can a sense of our having
received pardon be the condition of our receiving it?</p>

<p>“If you object, ‘We know fifteen hundred persons who have this
assurance.’ Perhaps so, but this does not prove that they were not
justified till they received it. 2. ‘We have been exceedingly blessed in
preaching this doctrine.’ We have been blessed in preaching the great
truths of the gospel; although we tacked to them, in the simplicity of our
hearts, a proposition which was not true. 3. ‘But does not our Church
give this account of justifying faith?’ I am sure she does of saving or
Christian faith; I think she does of justifying faith too. But to the law
and testimony. All men may err: but the word of the Lord shall stand
for ever.”<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This seems to clash with Wesley’s previously expressed
sentiments, and, in 1809, there was a somewhat bitter controversy
on the subject between the Rev. Melville Horne and the
Rev. Edward Hare and others. Suffice it to say here, that
the definition of faith in the Church of England’s homily on
salvation, which Wesley had been wont to quote, was rather a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span>
definition of the <i>habitual</i> faith of a justified man, than of the
<i>act</i> by which a sinner is first justified and saved.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Wesley
held this corrected view to the end of life.</p>

<p>As it respects the second question raised at the conference
of 1747, it was allowed—(1) That many of those who have
died in the faith were not made “perfect in love” till a little
before death; (2) that the term “sanctified” is continually
applied by St. Paul to all that are justified, but that, by
this term <i>alone</i>, he rarely, if ever, means saved from all sin,
and consequently, it is improper to use it in such a sense
without adding the word “wholly” or “entirely”; and
(3) that the inspired writers very rarely speak either of, or to
those who are wholly sanctified, and that therefore it behoves
us, in public at least, rarely to speak, in full and explicit
terms, concerning entire sanctification. Having conceded
such points (which may sound strangely in the ears of some
at the present day), the Conference proceeds to show most
conclusively, from numerous texts of Scripture, that believers
ought to expect to be saved from all sin, previous to death;
but exhorts such as have attained to this state of grace
not to speak of it to those who know not God, nor indeed to
any without some particular reason, without some particular
good in view, and even then to have an especial care to avoid
all appearance of boasting, and to speak more loudly and
convincingly by their lives, than they can do by their
tongues.</p>

<p>The remainder of the conference sittings were principally
occupied in determining miscellaneous matters. The right of
private judgment was enforced. All agreed to read, before
the next conference, all the tracts which had been published
by Wesley, and to mark every passage which they considered
to be wrong or dubious. It was ruled, that the Methodists were
not schismatics, any more than they were rebels or murderers.
It was agreed that they had been too limited in their field
preaching; and that they had paid “respect to persons,” by
devoting more of their time to the rich than to the poor, by not
speaking to them so plain as to the others, and by admitting
them into the society and bands, though they had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
received remission of sins, nor met in any band at all. Precautions
were to be employed in keeping from the Lord’s
table unworthy communicants, first, by exercising more care
in admitting members into the society, and secondly, by giving
notes to none but those who applied for them on the days
appointed in each quarter. Wesley’s “assistants” were now
twenty-two in number. The names of thirty-eight local
preachers are given, including a number, who, to some extent,
were already labouring as itinerants.</p>

<p>Who can fail to admire the simple, honest earnestness of
these early conclaves of godly Methodists?—men, without
preconceived ideas, desiring above all things to ascertain what
is truth, and to adopt the most useful plans in spreading it?
“In our first conference,” say they, “it was agreed to examine
every point from the foundation. Have we not been somewhat
fearful in doing this? What were we afraid of? Of
overturning our first principles? Whoever was afraid of this,
it was a vain fear. For if they are true, they will bear the
strictest examination. If they are false, the sooner they are
overturned the better. Let us all pray for a willingness to
receive light; an invariable desire to know of every doctrine,
whether it be of God.” Men animated by such a principle
were sure to have happy meetings, and were not likely to go
far astray.</p>

<p>On the Sunday after the conference ended, Wesley set out
for Cornwall. It was the eve of a parliamentary election,
and, at Exeter, while his clothes were being dried, he wrote
“A Word to a Freeholder;” and, at St. Ives, so successfully
warned the Methodists against bribery, that, though sorely
tempted, “not one of them would even eat or drink at
the expense of the candidate for whom they voted.” At
Plymouth, a lieutenant with his retinue of soldiers, drummers,
and a mob, came to make disturbance. At St. Agnes, the
rabble threw dirt and clods; and Mr. Shepherd’s horse,
taking fright, leaped over a man who was stooping down,
the poor fellow screaming most lustily, but escaping unhurt.
Here another man, learning that Wesley was about to
preach, said, “If he does, I’ll stone him,” and forthwith
began to fill his pockets with the needful missiles. He
reached the spot. Wesley took his text, “He that is with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>out
sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”
The man’s courage failed him, stone after stone stealthily
dropped from his well filled pockets, and he went away with
the impression that the preacher was something wonderful.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
At Sithney, Wesley met the stewards of all the Cornish
societies, and found that there were eighteen exhorters
in the county; that three of these had no gifts at all for
the work, neither natural nor supernatural; that a fourth
had neither gifts nor grace, but was a dull, empty, self conceited
man; and that a fifth had considerable gifts, but had
evidently made shipwreck of the grace of God. These,
therefore, he set aside, and advised the societies not to hear
them. The remaining thirteen were to preach when there
was no preacher in their own or the neighbouring societies,
provided that they would take no step without the advice of
those who had more experience than themselves. At
Newlyn, where Peter Jaco had been recently converted,<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
some poor wretches of Penzance began cursing and swearing,
and thrust Wesley down the bank on which he was preaching.
At Port Isaac, the mob hallooed and shouted, but none
except the captain lifted up his hand to strike. At Camelford,
a large train attended him, but only one stone struck
him. At Terdinny, the parson affirmed publicly in his
church, that Wesley’s errand was to obtain a hundred pounds,
which must be raised directly. These were the unpleasantnesses
of his journey; but, upon the whole, his visit was
happy and successful; and, almost in every place, he found
the good work prospering, as the following letter to his friend
Ebenezer Blackwell shows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">St. Ives</span>, <i>July 10, 1747</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—A great and effectual door is opened now, almost in
every corner of this country. There is such a change within these two
years as has hardly been seen in any other part of England. Wherever
we went, we used to carry our lives in our hands; and now there is not
a dog to wag his tongue. Several ministers are clearly convinced of
the truth; few are bitter; most seem to stand neuter. Some of the
gentlemen (so called) are almost the only opposers now; drinking, revelling,
cursing, swearing gentlemen, who neither will enter into the
kingdom of heaven themselves, nor suffer any others, if they can hinder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span>
it. The most violent Jacobites among these are continually crying out
that we are bringing the Pretender; and some of these worthy men bear
his majesty’s commission, as justices of the peace.</p>

<p class="psig">
“I am, dear sir,<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley got back to Bristol on August 1, and, three days
afterwards, set out for Ireland.</p>

<p>Poor Ireland! Even then, Ireland was England’s greatest
difficulty. A hundred years had elapsed since the bloody
rebellion of 1641; and more than half a century had passed
since King William’s victory at the battle of the Boyne.
Irish parliaments, during the reign of Anne, and the first
and second Georges, had riveted and extended the penal
laws against papists. Ireland was in a state of torpid tranquillity—a
slumbering volcano, stirred only by apprehensions
of internal commotion, or by the agitation of partisan
quarrels between the rival factions of court and country.
The massacre of 1641, and the sanguinary persecution in the
reign of the bigoted James II., were still fresh in the recollection
of Protestants, and heightened their animosity to the
utmost; while, on the other hand, discomfitures and disasters,
penal laws and legalized oppression, rendered the hatred of
the papists virulent beyond example. Irritating and maddening
circumstances fomented, on both sides, the most
rancorous malignity: protestantism was triumphant, and an
imperious papacy in a degrading bondage.</p>

<p>In England, Moravianism was the pioneer of Methodism;
and so it was in Ireland. In 1745, an English soldier in
Dublin formed a small society of pious people, and began
to preach to them. Just at this juncture, Benjamin La Trobe,
a young student in connection with the Baptists, having
finished his studies at the university of Glasgow, came to
Dublin, and became the leader of the little band, gathered
together by the soldier’s exertions, thirty of whom already
belonged to different religious churches. In the same year,
John Cennick withdrew himself from Whitefield’s connexion,
and transferred all the societies that he had been the means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>
of forming, to the care of the Moravians, while he himself
became a Moravian minister. At the request of the society,
organised by the soldier, and now presided over by Benjamin
La Trobe, John Cennick came to Dublin in June, 1746, and
began to preach in a chapel in Skinner’s Alley, which the
society had hired from the Baptists. The place was soon
crowded with hearers, and the society increased to about five
hundred members.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Cennick had to attend a Moravian synod in
Germany. During his absence, Thomas Williams, one of
Wesley’s itinerants, came to Dublin. Williams was a man of
attractive appearance, pleasing manners, and good address.
Holmes, in his “History of the United Brethren,” says that
Williams prevailed on several members of the society to leave
the Moravians and join the Methodists, and we have no
authority to deny the statement. It may be true, or it may
be otherwise. Certain it is, that, by some means, Williams
formed a separate society, and in a few weeks wrote to
Wesley,<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> who determined to visit Ireland without delay. The
results of this were vastly important. Forty-two times
Wesley crossed the Irish Channel, and spent, in his different
visits, at least half-a-dozen years of his laborious life in the
emerald isle. Ireland yielded him some of the most eminent
of his coadjutors—Thomas Walsh, Adam Clarke, Henry
Moore, and others; and Irishmen were ordained by Providence
to found Methodism, or to aid in founding it, in the
North American British provinces, in the West Indies, in
Africa, in India, and in Australia.</p>

<p>Wesley landed in Dublin Bay on Sunday morning,
August 9. His host was Mr. Lunell, a banker,<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> who afterwards
gave £400 towards the erection of the Methodist
chapel in Whitefriar Street.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>On the day of his landing, Wesley preached, in St. Mary’s
church, to “as gay and senseless a congregation as he ever
saw.” Next morning he met Thomas Williams’s society at
five; and at six preached in the large room, which was not
large enough to contain the congregation. He then went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
Mr. R——, the curate of St. Mary’s, who “professed abundance
of goodwill,” and commended Wesley’s sermon; but
“expressed the most rooted prejudice against lay preachers,
or preaching out of a church; and said, ‘the Archbishop of
Dublin was resolved to suffer no such irregularities in his
diocese.’”</p>

<p>The day after, Wesley waited on the archbishop; spent
above two hours in conversation with his grace; and answered
abundance of objections.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wesley and John Trembath (who was with
him) continued preaching in a chapel, originally designed for
a Lutheran church, which would accommodate about four
hundred people. This was in Marlborough Street,<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> and was
crowded with poor and rich, and ministers of every denomination.
Wesley devoted every morning to an explanation of
the rules of the Methodist societies, and preached twice a day
to many more than the meeting-house would hold. Four
days after his arrival, he wrote as follows, to his friend Mr.
Ebenezer Blackwell:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have found a home in this strange land. I am at Mr. Lunell’s just
as at the Foundery; only, that I have not such attendance here; for I
meet the people at another part of the town. For natural sweetness of
temper, for courtesy and hospitality, I have never seen any people like
the Irish. Indeed, all I converse with are only English transplanted into
another soil; and they are much mended by the removal, having left all
their roughness and surliness behind them. They receive the word of
God with all gladness and readiness of mind. The danger is, that it
should not take deep root, that it should be as seed falling on stony
ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Lunell and his family desire their best respects to Mrs. Blackwell
and you. His daughter can rejoice in God her Saviour. They propose
to spend the winter in England.”<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Saturday, August 15, Wesley arranged to see, at Mr.
Lunell’s, all who wished to speak with him. He writes: “I
found scarce any Irish among them. At least ninety-nine in
a hundred of the native Irish remain in the religion of their
forefathers. The Protestants, whether in Dublin or elsewhere,
are almost all transplanted lately from England. Nor is it
any wonder, that those who are born papists generally live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>
and die such, when the protestants can find no better ways to
convert them than penal laws and acts of parliament.”</p>

<p>He ascertained, by personal examination, that the Dublin
society, formed by Williams, consisted of about two hundred
and eighty members, “many of whom appeared to be strong
in faith.” Mr. La Trobe, the Moravian preacher, took alarm;
read to his congregation the “Short View of the Difference
between the Moravians,” etc.; and gave utterance to “bitter
words”; but this did service to the Methodists rather than
otherwise.</p>

<p>After spending exactly a fortnight in Dublin, Wesley returned
to England, and was succeeded by his brother Charles,
who arrived on September 9, with Charles Perronet as his
companion.</p>

<p>During the fortnight which had elapsed since Wesley left,
a mob had broken into the Marlborough Street chapel, and
destroyed all before them; goods of a considerable value had
been stolen; the pulpit and benches had been burnt openly in
the street, and several of the Methodists beaten with
shillalahs. Charles found that a new nickname had been
given to the poor Methodists. John Cennick, in his zeal against
popish idolatry, had said, “I curse and blaspheme all the
gods in heaven, but the Babe that lay in Mary’s lap, the Babe
that lay in swaddling clouts”; and, because of that, the
populace called him “swaddling John,” and the Methodists
“Swaddlers.” The Methodists were now without a meeting-house,
and Charles Wesley, at the peril of his life, regularly
preached on Oxmanton Green; but, within a month, he
bought a house near Dolphin’s Barn, the whole ground floor of
which was a weaver’s workshop.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> He writes on October 10,
to Mr. Blackwell:—“At my first coming here, we were so
persecuted, that no one in Dublin would venture to let us a
house or a room; but now their hearts are turned, and we
have the offer of several convenient places.”<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> And, in
another letter, to his brother, dated October 9, he remarks,
that he must either buy the house near Dolphin’s Barn, or
get some other lodgings, or take his flight. “<i>Here</i> I can stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</span>
no longer. A family of squalling children, a landlady just
ready to lie in, a maid who has no time to do the least thing
for us, are some of our inconveniences. Our two rooms for
four people allow no opportunity for four people. Charles
Perronet and I groan for elbow room in our press-bed; our
diet is answerable to our lodgings; we have no one to mend
our clothes and stockings, and no money to buy more.”<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
Under such circumstances, the weaver’s shop was turned into a
preaching house, and the rooms above it used as the Dublin
home of the two Wesleys and their itinerants. Charles
Wesley opened the “New House” on October 25, “by
preaching to a great multitude within and without”; and,
though he preached not fewer than five times during the day,
and also attended a three hours’ service at St. Patrick’s, he
“was as fresh” at night as he was when he commenced his
labour in the morning. The Dublin society contributed upwards
of £70 towards the expenses; Charles Wesley remained
more than six months as their devoted minister; and
Methodism in Ireland was fairly started.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Wesley also gave
the Irish Methodists a hymn-book of 336 pages, entitled
“Hymns and Sacred Poems. Dublin: printed in the year
1747.” The hymns were 246 in number, and embodied much
of the Methodist history of the past eight years; but, with
this brief notice, we must leave them.</p>

<p>On his return to England, at the end of August, Wesley
made his way from Holyhead to Bristol, preaching in streets,
in churchyards, on tombstones, in meadows, in castle yards,
and wherever he had a chance. At Cardiff, he found the
society filled with vain janglings, by J. Prosser, “an honest,
well meaning man; but no more qualified, either by nature or
grace, to expound Scripture, than to read lectures in logic or
algebra.”</p>

<p>Hurrying up to London, which he reached on September
11, he recommenced his ministry in Moorfields, and declares,
that, excepting that at West Street, he knew no congregation
in London so serious as this. He made brief visits to Shoreham,
Newington, and Lewisham, where he employed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span>
in writing. He examined the London classes, “and every
person severally, touching that bane of religion, evil speaking.”
He witnessed some happy deaths; among others that of Mrs.
Witham, “an eminent pattern of calm boldness for the truth;
of simplicity and godly sincerity; of zeal for God, and for all
good works; and of self denial in every kind.” He advised
his preachers, and wrote to one of them as follows:—“In
public preaching, speak not one word against opinions of any
kind. We are not to fight against notions, but sins. Least
of all should I advise you once to open your lips against
predestination. It would do more mischief than you are
aware of. Keep to our one point, present inward salvation
by faith, by the Divine evidence of sins forgiven.”<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>Having spent eleven weeks in London and its vicinity, he
set out, on November 30, for Bristol, calling at Salisbury on
his way. Five weeks before, Westley Hall, the base husband
of his sister Martha, had infamously deserted his wife and
family. The following is an <i>extract</i> from a letter published in
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> Some parts of the letter are so
grossly filthy that it would be a pollution to insert them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, <i>October 30, 1747</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“There have been, for some years past, a considerable number of
Methodists in this city, who were at first collected, and have since continued
under the guidance of Mr. Hall, as their minister. This man, by
an uncommon appearance of sanctity, joined with indefatigable labour in
field and house preaching, drew multitudes of the meaner sort, both of
Dissenters and the Established Church, to attend him. And, though he
has continually advanced the grossest absurdities, both in his preaching
and writings, yet he has so bewitched his followers, that his words had
greater weight with them than the words of Christ and His apostles.</p>

<p>“Many sober and judicious persons have often expressed their fears,
that the nocturnal meetings held at his house were scenes of debauchery;
for, now and then, a bastard child was brought into the world by some of
his female devotees.... Last Wednesday, he took formal leave
of his corrupted flock, and had the impudence to justify his infamous conduct
from the case of Elkanah (1 Sam. i. 1, 2), which he largely expounded.
On Friday morning he set out for London, having first stripped his
wife (a virtuous woman by whom he has had several children) of all her
childbed linen, and whatever he could readily convert into money, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span>
her in the deepest distress. The fire of jealousy has broken out in many
families, where <i>wives</i> or <i>daughters</i> were his followers.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley reached the desolate home of his poor sister on
December 1, and wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From the concurring accounts of many witnesses, who spoke no
more than they personally knew, I now learned as much as is hitherto
brought to light concerning the fall of poor Mr. Hall. Twelve years ago,
he was, without question, filled with faith and the love of God. He was
a pattern of humility, meekness, seriousness, and above all, of self denial;
so that in all England I knew not his fellow. It were easy to point
out the several steps, whereby he fell from his steadfastness; even till
he fell into a course of adultery, yea, and avowed it in the face of the
sun!”</p>
</div>

<p>Wesley spent two days with his unhappy sister, and then
says: “I took my leave of this uncomfortable place, and set
out for Bristol.” Two months later, he returned to Salisbury
to see the poor miserable wretch; but he was refused admittance,
and his sister also was shut out of doors.</p>

<p>Nothing now remains, except to notice Wesley’s publications
during 1747. The Dublin hymn-book has been mentioned.
The others were the following:—</p>

<p>1. “A Word to a Protestant.” 12mo, 16 pages.</p>

<p>2. “A Word to a Freeholder.” 12mo, four pages. This,
as already stated, was written at Exeter, while halting on a
journey, and on the eve of a parliamentary election.</p>

<p>3. “A Letter to the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of
London; occasioned by his lordship’s late charge to his
clergy.” 12mo, 32 pages. Wesley replies to the bishop’s
accusations, and concludes thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our one aim is, to proselyte sinners to repentance. If this be not
done, we will stand condemned; not as well meaning fools, but as devils
incarnate; but if it be, then, my lord, neither you nor any man beside, can
oppose and fortify people against us, without being found even to fight
against God. There are, in and near Moorfields, ten thousand poor souls,
for whom Christ died, rushing headlong into hell. Is Dr. Bulkeley, the
parochial minister, both willing and able to stop them? If so, let it be
done, and I have no place in these parts. I go, and call other sinners
to repentance. But if, after all that he has done, and all he can do, they
are still in the broad way to destruction, let me see if God will put a word
even in my mouth. My lord, the time is short. I am past the noon of
life. Your lordship is old and full of days, having passed the usual age of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span>
man.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> It cannot therefore be long before we shall both stand naked before
God. Will you then rejoice in your success in opposing our doctrine?
The Lord God grant it may not be said in that hour, ‘These have perished
in their iniquity; but their blood I require at thy hands.’—I am, your
lordship’s dutiful son and servant,</p>

<p class="psig">
“<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Appended to the letter is a magnificent hymn, of nine
twelve lined stanzas, expressive of a calm and firm determination
still to persevere, at all hazards, in preaching the gospel
of his great Master.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>4. “Lessons for Children.” Part II., 12mo, 108 pages.
The lessons are fifty-four in number, and consist of Scripture
selections, from the time of the Israelites passing over Jordan
to the reign of Hezekiah.</p>

<p>5. “Primitive Physic; or an easy and natural Method of
curing most Diseases.” 12mo, 119 pages. The publication
of this remarkable book arose out of the great success of
Wesley’s dispensary, opened in 1746. At the time of his
death, it had reached its twenty-third edition.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> It has often
been ridiculed; but perhaps unwisely. The Rev. Samuel
Romilly Hall remarks:—“A medical gentleman of Leeds,
reputed as eminently intelligent and skilful in his profession,
has declared to me, that the unfriendly criticisms, so freely
given on Wesley’s ‘Primitive Physic,’ are altogether unwarrantable.
He affirms, that, judged of in comparison with
other non-professional works of the same class, and of the
same date, the ‘Primitive Physic’ is incomparably superior
to anything that he knows.”<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>Besides, those who laugh at Wesley’s “Primitive Physic”
ought to remember:—(1) At no remote period from
Wesley’s day, it was not unusual for Christian ministers
to practise medicine. (2) Wesley says, “For six and twenty
years, I had made anatomy and physic the diversion of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</span>
leisure hours.” (3) Wesley was not a quack. “I took,” says
he, “into my assistance an apothecary, and an experienced
surgeon.”</p>

<p>It is a remarkable incident, that the medical profession, so
generally impatient of medical empirics, allowed Wesley’s
work to circulate for nearly thirty years before any of their
honourable fraternity deigned to notice or denounce it. In
1776, an octavo pamphlet of 83 pages was published with the
following title:—“An Examination of the Rev. Mr. John
Wesley’s Primitive Physic; showing that a great number of
the prescriptions therein contained are founded on ignorance
of the medical art, and of the power and operations of
medicine; and, that it is a publication calculated to do
essential injury to the health of those persons who may place
confidence in it. By W. Hawes, M.D.” Of the medical merits
of this production we have no ability to judge. In many
instances, it is in the highest degree ironical; though its author
affirms, he was totally unknown to Wesley, and had no
personal animosity against him. Dr. Hawes was unquestionably
a man of great eminence in his profession; but he is
chiefly known as the founder of the Humane Society, thirty
of whose managers and directors attended his funeral in
1808.</p>

<p>Before closing the present chapter of Wesley’s history, it
must be added, that, about the same time that his “Primitive
Physic” was given to the public, he also issued a small
pamphlet, at the price of twopence, entitled “Receipts for
the Use of the Poor”; but as these were extracted from the
former publication no further notice is needed.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> A story is told by the Rev. John Reynolds, in his “Anecdotes of
Wesley,” p. 8, to the effect that Wesley was deeply moved while at
Oxford, by an odd interview which he had with the porter of his college.
This man late one evening went to the young collegian’s room, and said
he wished to talk with him. After a little pleasantry, Wesley told him to
go home and get another coat. The porter replied, “This is the only
coat I have in the world, and I thank God for it.” Wesley said, “Go
home, and get your supper.” The man responded, “I have had nothing
to-day but a drink of water, and I thank God for that.” Wesley remarked,
“It is late, and you will be locked out, and then what will you have to
thank God for?” “I will thank Him,” replied the porter, “that I have
the dry stones to lie upon.” “John,” said Wesley, “you thank God when
you have nothing to wear, nothing to eat, and no bed to lie upon. What
else do you thank Him for?” “I thank Him,” returned the poor fellow,
“that He has given me life and being; and a heart to love Him, and a
desire to serve Him.” Reynolds says this was related by Wesley himself,
and that the interview made a lasting impression on Wesley’s mind, and
convinced him there was something in religion to which he was as yet a
stranger.</p>

effect on Dr. Johnson. “When at Oxford,” says Johnson, “I took it up
expecting to find it a dull book, and perhaps to laugh at it. But I found
Law quite an over-match for me; and this was the first occasion of my
thinking in earnest of religion after I became capable of religious inquiry.”</p>

till Dr. Burton pressed him to go to Georgia. This is a fair objection;
but the reader will do well to remember that the above statement was
made by Wesley in the year 1785; and that it is only reasonable to suppose
that Wesley, at the moment, forgot his correspondence with Broughton
fifty years previous.</p>

Moravians in England; and that it was by his exertions <i>mainly</i> that the
Moravian missions in North America were taken under government protection.
He was often contemptuously spoken of as “the deaf old
Moravian”: but he was a scholar and a gentleman; had intercourse with
persons of the highest rank; and was a frequent and almost familiar
visitor of George III. and his Queen Charlotte. For many years, his
difficulty of hearing was such that he could converse only by the use of
an ear trumpet; but his face was always lit up with intellect, and his life
was spent in doing good. He died in 1795.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_221" href="#FNanchor_221" class="label">[221]</a> It is a remarkable fact that, though Savannah is the chief city in the
state of Georgia, Methodism hardly has an existence in it. Wesley left
it in 1737; and three years after, Whitefield founded his Savannah
Orphan House, which has long since crumbled into ruins. Nothing more
was done until 1790, when Hope Hull was sent to Savannah and preached
a few times in a chairmaker’s shop, but met with more mob violence
than spiritual success. Ten years later, John Garvin tried to collect a
society; but the attempt was a failure. The South Carolina Conference,
held in 1806, appointed Samuel Dunwody, and he succeeded in forming
the first Methodist society in Savannah since the breaking up of that formed
by Wesley seventy years previously. Dunwody’s society consisted of
twelve members, five of them white and seven coloured. After hard toiling
a chapel was erected in Savannah in 1812, and was opened by Bishop
Asbury; but, to the present day, the opposition to Methodism is most
decided, and the Methodist society and congregation are extremely poor
and meagre. (See Dr. Dixon’s “Methodism in America,” p. 282.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_222" href="#FNanchor_222" class="label">[222]</a> It is right to add that Mr. Stephens, the trustees’ secretary, who, upon
the whole, evinces a friendly spirit towards Wesley, gives a somewhat
scurvy character of Wesley’s companions. One of them, Coates, a
constable, had been one of the principal fomenters of mischief, a busy
fellow, going from house to house with idle stories to fill people’s heads
with jealousies, and distinguishing himself by a most inveterate opposition
to all the rules of government. He was greatly in debt, and had never
improved one foot of land since his arrival in the province. Gough,
a tithingman, was an idle fellow, pert and impudent in his behaviour,
always kicking against the civil power, and making it his business to
inflame sedition. He also was in debt; and left behind him a wife and
child, who scarce grieved at his departure, for he used to beat them more
than feed them. Campbell, a barber, was an insignificant loose fellow,
fit for any leader that would make a tool of him, and whose only motive
for going off was to escape his creditors.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that this is true; but it by no means follows
that these vagabonds were Wesley’s <i>friends</i>. They seem to have been
<i>fugitives</i> as well as he. Misfortune makes a man acquainted with strange
bedfellows; still, leaving in such company was an ugly fact, and was
used to Wesley’s disadvantage. Mr. Stephens writes: “As I was always
ready and willing, in conversation or otherwise, to make allowance for
Mr. Wesley’s failings in policy, and was careful not to run hastily into a
belief of all I heard against him, I was now asked, in a sneering way,
what my sentiments were of him? ‘<i>Noscitur ex sociis</i>’ was the common
byword; and all I had to say was that he must stand or fall by himself,
when his cause came before the trustees.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_271" href="#FNanchor_271" class="label">[271]</a> Since writing the above, we have met with one of Wesley’s letters in
Rawlinson’s Continuation of Wood’s “Athenæ Oxoniensis,” in which he
states that he published “A Collection of Psalms and Hymns,” in 1736.
Is this date an error?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_272" href="#FNanchor_272" class="label">[272]</a> The <i>Weekly Miscellany</i> for February 10, 1739, and in subsequent
numbers, states that there was considerable chicanery practised in securing
Whitefield the pulpit of St. Margaret’s. It was pretended that a
friendly society desired him to preach for the benefit of their funds; but
the treasurer of the society, and four of its six trustees, signed and published
a document contradicting this assertion. Of the two remaining,
one was from home at the time, and the other was a Mr. Bennett, who
assisted the crowd in pushing Whitefield into the pulpit. There
can be little doubt that Whitefield was deceived by Bennett, and that it
was a mistake for him to preach at St. Margaret’s when he did. In the
same weekly journal, it is asserted that Charles Wesley had been guilty
of the same illegal act, by taking possession of the pulpit at Bloomsbury.
His friends asked the pulpit for him; the request was refused; and yet he
came into the preacher’s pew; sat next the door; and, as soon as prayers
were over, went into the pulpit and preached, to the great surprise of the
clergyman, who intended to preach himself. We have no means of either
confirming or refuting this.</p>

p. 188, tells us that “a severe frost began at Christmas, and continued
till the latter end of February. The Thames was covered with such
a crust of ice that a multitude of people dwelled upon it in tents, and
a great number of booths were erected for the entertainment of the
populace. The navigation was entirely stopped; the fruits of the earth
were destroyed; many persons were chilled to death; the price of all
sorts of provisions rose almost to a dearth; and even water was sold in
the streets of London.”</p>

assizes. This, at their request, he published, octavo, thirty-two pages.
One extract may suffice. Speaking of the Methodists, he describes them
as “our modern enthusiasts, pretending to be the only true believers;
and by whom the Established Church and clergy had been outraged with
unparalleled virulence and malice, insolence and contempt.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_336" href="#FNanchor_336" class="label">[336]</a> This is true. Hence the following, taken from a sermon published by
Annesley in 1661:—“There are believers of several growths in the church
of God: fathers, young men, children, and babes; and as, in most families,
there are more babes and children than grown men, so in the church
of God there are more weak, doubting Christians, than strong ones, grown
up to a full assurance. A babe may be born and yet not know it; so a
man may be born again, and not be sure of it. Sometimes they think
they have grounds of hope, that they shall be saved; sometimes they think
they have grounds of fears, that they shall be condemned. Not knowing
which might be most weighty, like a pair of balances, they are in equipoise.”</p>

malefactors, was executed at Tyburn. While lying under sentence of
death in Newgate prison, he requested Wesley to visit him; and twice
his old master went, but was refused admittance. (<i>London Magazine</i>,

<p><a id="Footnote_428" href="#FNanchor_428" class="label">[428]</a> It was hardly honest of Wesley to publish this without a word of
acknowledgment as to its author and origin. We have compared it with
“A Dialogue between the Baptist and Presbyterian; wherein the Presbyterians
are punished, by their own pens, for their cruel and self-devouring
doctrines, making God the ordainer of all the sins of men and devils, and
reprobating the greatest part of mankind without any help of salvation.
By Thomas Grantham, Messenger of the Baptized Churches in Lincolnshire.
London: 1691.” 4to, pages 18; and have no hesitancy in saying,
that Wesley’s Dialogue, abridged and altered, is taken from that of
Grantham.</p>

An exhortation to a religious and virtuous life. (2) General directions

last chapter is exceedingly objectionable. It unmistakably teaches
apostolical succession, confession, priestly absolution, and other favourite
dogmas of the high church party of the present day.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_476" href="#FNanchor_476" class="label">[476]</a> Early in the year 1742, an eightpenny pamphlet was published, which
Wesley never noticed. Its title was, “A Letter to the Rev. Mr. John
Wesley, in vindication of the Doctrines of absolute, unconditional
Election, particular Redemption, special Vocation, and final Perseverance.
Occasioned chiefly by some things in his Dialogue between a Presbyterian
and his Friend; and in his Hymns on God’s Everlasting Love.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_478" href="#FNanchor_478" class="label">[478]</a> Since the above was written, we have met with one of Wesley’s
letters, in Rawlinson’s Continuation of Wood’s “Athenæ Oxoniensis,” in
which he states that he published, “An Abridgment of Mr. Norris’s
Christian Prudence, and Reflections on the Conduct of our Understanding,”
in 1734.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_566" href="#FNanchor_566" class="label">[566]</a> Cudworth published two replies to Wesley; one in 1745, entitled, “A
Dialogue between a Preacher of inherent righteousness and a Preacher of
God’s righteousness: being an answer to a late Dialogue between an
Antinomian and his friend.” 12mo, 12 pages. Another, in 1746, with
the title, “Truth defended and cleared from mistakes and misrepresentations.”
12mo, 52 pages. In both of these productions, Cudworth shows
great ability, and though his opinions, as there expressed, are far from
orthodox, yet, unless other facts can be alleged against him, he hardly
deserves the hard things which Wesley said of him.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
